## [5.1.1] — 2026-09-23

### Security

Follow-up to 5.1.0 resolving the full **CodeQL code-scanning** backlog and
tightening CI posture. No behavioral changes to backup/restore.

- **Log injection** — user/remote-derived values (repo, session, file, and
  owner names) are now passed through a `logger.sanitize()` barrier that strips
  CR/LF/control characters before interpolation, preventing forged log entries.
- **DOM XSS** — HTML-escaped all remaining dashboard sinks (GitHub username,
  Drive folder name/ID, OAuth errors, toast messages, restore preview, and the
  access allow-list), and escaped values interpolated into an `onclick`
  attribute.
- **Insecure temporary files** — the PAT-expiry marker and JSON mirror scratch
  file now use the app-owned temp dir with unpredictable names; tests use
  `fs.mkdtempSync`.
- **Insecure randomness** — replaced `Math.random()` gradient-id generation with
  `crypto.randomUUID()`.
- **Missing rate limiting** — added a global rate limiter covering the static
  assets and SPA catch-all route (tunable via `GLOBAL_RATE_LIMIT`), on top of
  the stricter `/api` limiter.
- **CI posture** — added least-privilege top-level `permissions:` to all
  workflows and pinned the Docker base image by digest.
- Removed dead/unused locals flagged by CodeQL.

## [5.1.0] — 2026-09-23

### Security

A dedicated security-hardening release. No breaking changes; all existing
backups remain restorable.

- **Authenticated encryption (AES-256-GCM).** `encryption-key` archives are now
  written with AES-256-GCM streaming authenticated encryption (magic-header
  format `GCM1 | IV | ciphertext | auth-tag`), so tampering with a backup is
  detected on restore instead of silently decrypting to corrupt data. Legacy
  AES-256-CBC archives from earlier versions still decrypt transparently for
  backward compatibility.
- **No secrets or repo data through a shell.** Every `git` invocation now uses
  `execFileSync` with an argument array (no shell interpolation), eliminating
  command-injection exposure from repository, branch, or path names. The GitLab
  token is passed via `http.extraheader` in `GIT_CONFIG_*` env vars instead of
  being embedded in the clone URL or argv, so it never appears in process
  listings, shell history, or error output.
- **Dashboard server hardening.** The optional Express status server now sets
  security headers via **helmet**, applies **express-rate-limit** (default 100
  requests / 15 min, tunable via `API_RATE_LIMIT`), binds to `127.0.0.1` by
  default (override with `HOST`), and can gate the `/api` routes behind a
  constant-time API-key check (`DASHBOARD_API_KEY`, compared with
  `crypto.timingSafeEqual`). A warning is logged if no key is configured.
- **Content-Security-Policy + output escaping on the dashboard SPA.** All
  remote-sourced values (repo names, session names, run details, storage
  tooltips) are HTML-escaped, and a restrictive CSP `<meta>` locks down
  `connect-src`/`script-src` to the required Google and GitHub origins,
  mitigating stored/reflected XSS.
- **Supply-chain hardening.**
  - All GitHub Actions across every workflow (and `action.yml`) are **pinned to
    full commit SHAs** with a trailing `# vN` comment so Dependabot can still
    track upstream releases.
  - Runtime dependency installs use `npm ci --ignore-scripts` (with an
    `npm install --ignore-scripts` fallback) in workflows, the composite Action,
    and the Dockerfile, preventing arbitrary install-time script execution.
  - Added an **OpenSSF Scorecard** workflow (`scorecard.yml`) that publishes
    results to the code-scanning dashboard.
  - `npm audit` remediated to **0 known vulnerabilities**. Removed the unused
    `multer` dependency (resolving four Dependabot alerts and reducing attack
    surface) and pinned `qs` and `js-yaml` to patched versions via `overrides`.

### Added
- `DASHBOARD_API_KEY`, `HOST`, and `API_RATE_LIMIT` environment variables
  (documented in `.env.example`, README, and the user guide).

## [5.0.6] — 2026-07-20

### Fixed
- Shortened the Action `description` to <125 characters, as required by the
  GitHub Marketplace publish validation.

## [5.0.5] — 2026-07-20

### Changed
- Action Marketplace title set to **"GitHub Backup and Restore"**.

## [5.0.4] — 2026-07-20

### Changed
- **Marketplace-ready Action metadata** — removed the `→` glyph from the Action
  name (it can break Marketplace slugs). Branding (icon `hard-drive`, color
  `blue`), inputs, and outputs unchanged.
- Publishing a moving **`v5`** major tag so `uses: OmarRao/github-gdrive-backup@v5`
  and `ghcr.io/omarrao/github-gdrive-backup:v5` resolve.

---

## [5.0.3] — 2026-07-20

### Fixed (dashboard)
- **Storage Growth chart redesigned.** The previous chart used
  `preserveAspectRatio="none"`, which stretched the viewBox and rendered blurry,
  non-uniformly-scaled strokes and text. It now renders at the container's exact
  pixel size (1 unit = 1 px) for crisp output, with a **smooth gradient area
  curve** (Catmull-Rom bezier), light gridlines, MB y-axis labels, and dated
  x-axis ticks. Interactive hover/focus tooltip retained.
- Updated `dashboard-insights.svg` and USERGUIDE §15A to match.

---

## [5.0.2] — 2026-07-20

### Changed (dashboard UX)
- **System Health tiles are now interactive** — each tile is a button (click or
  keyboard) that navigates to its section (Last Backup→Runs, SLA/Anomaly→Reports,
  Restore Verified→Restore, Signature/Storage/GitHub/Drive→Settings), with hover
  and focus states and a hover arrow.
- **Storage Growth chart points are interactive** — hovering/focusing a point
  shows a rich tooltip (session name, size, delta mode, date) and enlarges the
  active point.
- **Removed the ✅ glyph** from the Last Backup stat card (demo mode).

---

## [5.0.1] — 2026-07-20

### Changed
- Dependency updates: `googleapis` → ^176, `globals` (dev) → ^17, plus transitive
  patches. `npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities; 105/105 tests pass.

### Fixed
- Cleanup retention (#33): simple 21-day age-based retention, OAuth refresh-token
  auth, removed the unimplemented "GFS" workflow logging; docs corrected.

### Security/quality
- Added a **CodeQL** code-scanning workflow (security-and-quality queries).

---

## [5.0.0] — 2026-07-20

### Added — Trust & verification
- **Signed manifests (Ed25519)** — `src/lib/manifest-signing.js`; `BACKUP_SIGNING_KEY`
  signs `manifest.json` → `manifest.json.sig`, verified on restore with
  `BACKUP_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY` (`BACKUP_REQUIRE_SIGNATURE=true` to enforce).
- **Recovery scorecard** — `src/lib/recovery-scorecard.js`; the monthly restore
  drill publishes `docs/recovery-scorecard.json` (last verified restore + RTO),
  shown as a README endpoint badge and a dashboard tile.
- **Tamper-evident audit log** — audit entries are now hash-chained with a
  `verifyChain()` validator.

### Added — Distribution
- **GitHub Action** (`action.yml`) — `uses: OmarRao/github-gdrive-backup@v5`,
  no fork required; outputs a JSON `summary`.
- **GHCR publish workflow** (`publish.yml`) — container image on each release
  with SBOM + signed build provenance.

### Changed
- Dashboard System Health adds **Restore Verified** and **Manifest Signature** tiles.
- Docs, `.env.example`, and screenshots updated; SW cache → v6.

### Security
- **Removed `extract-zip`** (GHSA-jmr9-qjv8-65gv, symlink path traversal, no fix
  available) and replaced it with `node-stream-zip` behind a path-safe extractor
  (`src/lib/safe-extract.js`) that rejects `..`, absolute paths, and symlinks.
  `npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities.

### Notes
- New crypto/scorecard/audit/extraction logic is unit-tested (24 new tests, 105 total).
  No change to existing backup/restore data formats.

---

## [4.1.0] — 2026-07-17

### Performance
- **Streaming SHA-256 & AES-256-CBC** — new `src/lib/archive-crypto.js` streams
  hashing and encrypt/decrypt through fixed-size chunks instead of reading whole
  archives into memory (removed ~3× buffering on encrypt). Constant peak memory
  regardless of archive size; byte-for-byte identical output. Wired into backup
  and restore.
- **Batched git object validation** — `existingShas` now uses a single
  `git cat-file --batch-check` process instead of one per ref.
- **Configurable zip compression** — `BACKUP_ZIP_LEVEL` (default 6) for faster,
  less CPU-intensive archiving; set 9 for maximum compression.
- **Faster SPA first load** — `preconnect`/`dns-prefetch` resource hints for the
  Firebase / Google auth / GitHub / Drive origins to cut connection-setup latency.

### Notes
- Behavior-preserving: same hashes, same on-disk encryption format, verified by
  new `tests/archive-crypto.test.js` (round-trip + legacy-format compatibility).
