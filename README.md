### First-Run Setup

On your first sign-in the dashboard **gates itself** until your own GitHub and Google Drive are connected — it never shows stale or upstream data. A guided setup checklist tracks the four required steps and links straight to the relevant Settings sections. The dashboard automatically targets **your fork** (derived from the GitHub Pages URL), so every deployment shows its own live data.

![First-Run Setup](docs/screenshots/onboarding.svg)

### Dashboard

A polished Firebase-authenticated login screen gates the dashboard, with Google Sign-In and a one-click Demo Mode. The main overview shows repository count, backup session count, time since last run, and active workflow status — each stat card includes an SLA badge and trend indicator. A colored top accent bar, the signed-in user's avatar in the nav, and system Segoe UI typography round out the v3.0.0 visual overhaul.

![Dashboard](docs/screenshots/dashboard.svg)

![Dashboard — Dark Mode](docs/screenshots/dashboard-dark.svg)

---

### Backup

Select individual repos or back up everything in one shot. Toggle exactly what to include — source code, issues, PRs, releases, wiki, labels, and milestones — then trigger the GitHub Actions workflow instantly from the dashboard.

![Backup](docs/screenshots/backup.svg)

---

### Restore

Browse timestamped backup sessions loaded live from Google Drive. Select a session, optionally filter repos and specify a target owner, then trigger the restore workflow directly without leaving the dashboard.

![Restore](docs/screenshots/restore.svg)

---

### Reports & Session Diff

Track backup success rates, consecutive-day streaks, failure counts, and full run history. Every backup and restore run is listed with its status, trigger type, duration, and a direct link. Export the full history as a CSV with one click.

The **Session Diff** view compares any two backup sessions side by side — showing added, removed, changed, and unchanged repositories with exact byte deltas so you can spot unexpected growth or missing repos instantly.

![Reports](docs/screenshots/reports.svg)

![Session Diff](docs/screenshots/reports-diff.svg)

---

### Anomaly Detection

The dashboard automatically detects when a backup session size deviates significantly from the 7-day rolling average. An amber banner surfaces the alert immediately so you can investigate before a silent data loss becomes a problem.

![Dashboard — Anomaly Alert](docs/screenshots/dashboard-anomaly.svg)

---

### Settings

Configure your GitHub Personal Access Token, connect Google Drive via OAuth, verify your backup folder ID, and review all required Actions secrets. The five Settings tabs — Google Drive, Storage, SLA, Access Control, and Security — cover quota monitoring, S3/Azure targets, SLA tracking, restore allow-lists, and encryption. Tokens are stored in `localStorage` only — never sent to any third party.

![Settings](docs/screenshots/settings.svg)

---

### Demo Mode

Click **"Explore with sample data →"** on the login screen to enter Demo Mode — no authentication required. The dashboard is populated with realistic sample data (5 repositories, 30 daily backup sessions, workflow run history including a simulated failure) — all stats, graphs, delta composition and fan-out status are **derived from one internally-consistent dataset**. A persistent banner reminds you that live actions are disabled until you sign in.

![Demo Mode](docs/screenshots/demo-mode.svg)

---

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

Install the dashboard directly on your desktop or mobile home screen. The included service worker caches the app shell for instant offline loading — no app store needed.

![PWA Install](docs/screenshots/pwa-install.svg)

---

### CI Pipeline — Build, Lint & Test

Every push and pull request to `main` runs the full CI pipeline: copyright header verification, ESLint, Jest tests, npm security audit, YAML lint, and secret scanning — all gates must pass before merge.

![CI Pipeline](docs/screenshots/ci-security.svg)

---

### Dashboard Insights — Health, Storage Growth & Timeline

The dashboard opens with a **System Health** panel — a traffic-light summary of last backup, SLA, anomaly state, storage usage, and connection status. Below it, a **Storage Growth** area chart plots session size across the last 10 backups, and a 30-day **Backup Timeline** heatmap surfaces gaps and failures at a glance. Click any session to open a detail drawer showing a **Restore Confidence Score** and per-repo sizes.

![Dashboard Insights](docs/screenshots/dashboard-insights.svg)

---

### Command Palette

Press <kbd>⌘</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> anywhere to open a fuzzy command palette — jump to any page or fire an action (trigger backup, export CSV/JSON, toggle theme) without touching the mouse. Full arrow-key navigation and Enter to run.

![Command Palette](docs/screenshots/command-palette.svg)

---

### Backup Composition, Chain Lineage & Restore Wizard

The dashboard surfaces the latest session's **delta composition** (full / delta / unchanged) and **3-2-1 fan-out** status per mirror target. The session drawer visualizes each repo's **delta chain lineage** and Restore Confidence. The **Restore Wizard** builds the exact `gh workflow run` command for any provider (GitHub / GitLab / Gitea / local) and session — copy and go.

![Composition & Restore Wizard](docs/screenshots/composition-wizard.svg)

## Quick Start

### 1. Fork and clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OmarRao/github-gdrive-backup.git
cd github-gdrive-backup
npm install
```

### 2. Create Google Cloud OAuth credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) → **APIs & Services → Credentials**
2. Enable the **Google Drive API** for your project
3. Create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** — type: **Web application**
4. Add `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io` as an **Authorised JavaScript origin**
5. Add `http://localhost:8080` as an **Authorised redirect URI**
6. Download the JSON and save as `credentials/google-client-secret.json`

### 3. Run the one-time OAuth flow

```bash
python get_token.py
```

Follow the browser prompt. The token is auto-captured and saved to `credentials/google-token.json`.

### 4. Create a Google Drive backup folder

Create a folder in Drive. Copy the folder ID from its URL:

```
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_FOLDER_ID
```

### 5. Add GitHub Actions secrets

Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add these 5 secrets:

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `GH_BACKUP_TOKEN` | GitHub PAT with `repo`, `workflow`, `read:org`, `read:user` scopes |
| `GH_USER` | Your GitHub username or organisation name |
| `GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID` | The folder ID from step 4 |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Full JSON contents of `credentials/google-client-secret.json` |

| `SENDGRID_API_KEY` | SendGrid API key for email digest (`notify.yml`, `sla-check.yml`, `pat-check.yml`) |
| `PAT_EXPIRY_DATE` | Your PAT expiry date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format — triggers rotation reminder workflow |
| `SLA_HOURS` | Max hours since last backup before SLA breach alert fires (default: `26`) |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS access key (when `STORAGE_TARGET=s3`) |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS secret key (when `STORAGE_TARGET=s3`) |
| `AWS_BUCKET_NAME` | S3 bucket name (when `STORAGE_TARGET=s3`) |

| `GITLAB_TOKEN` | GitLab PAT (`api`, `write_repository`) — for cross-provider restore to GitLab |
| `GITLAB_HOST` | GitLab base URL (default `https://gitlab.com`) — for self-hosted GitLab |
| `GITEA_TOKEN` | Gitea access token with repo write scope — for cross-provider restore to Gitea |
| `GITEA_HOST` | Gitea base URL, e.g. `https://gitea.example.com` |

### 6. Trigger your first backup

Go to **Actions → Scheduled GitHub → Google Drive Backup → Run workflow**, or open the live dashboard and click **Backup → Trigger Backup Workflow**.

---

## Dashboard Pages

The dashboard at **https://omarrao.github.io/github-gdrive-backup/** has six pages:

| Page | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | Stats overview and recent workflow run history |
| **Backup** | Select repos, choose data types, toggle incremental mode, trigger backup |
| **Restore** | Browse Drive sessions, preview impact, trigger restore |
| **Workflow Runs** | Full list of all backup and restore runs with live status |
| **Reports** | Success rate, streak, run breakdown table, CSV export |
| **Settings — GitHub** | GitHub token, username, multi-account management |
| **Settings — Google Drive** | OAuth connect, folder ID |
| **Settings — Retention** | Configure auto-deletion period and schedule |
| **Settings — Actions Secrets** | Reference for all required secrets |
| **Settings — Setup Guide** | Step-by-step onboarding |

> **Security:** GitHub token and Drive token are stored in `localStorage` only. They are sent to `api.github.com` and `www.googleapis.com` respectively — no third party ever receives them.

## Configuration Reference

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...
GITHUB_USER=your-username

GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_PATH=./credentials/google-client-secret.json
GOOGLE_TOKEN_PATH=./credentials/google-token.json
GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID=1abc...xyz

BACKUP_INCLUDE=code,issues,pull_requests,releases,wiki,labels,milestones
BACKUP_CONCURRENCY=3
BACKUP_TMP_DIR=./tmp
BACKUP_ZIP_LEVEL=6          # zip compression 0-9 (lower = faster, larger)

# Multi-destination fan-out (3-2-1) — Drive is always primary
BACKUP_MIRROR_TARGETS=s3,b2

# True delta uploads — only new git objects each session (git bundle chain)
INCREMENTAL_MODE=delta

PORT=3000
```

### Performance notes

The backup and restore paths are **streaming and memory-bounded**, so archive
size — not available RAM — is the limit:

- **Streaming hash & crypto.** SHA-256 hashing and AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt
  stream the archive through in fixed-size chunks (`src/lib/archive-crypto.js`).
  Peak memory stays roughly constant regardless of repo size, avoiding the
  out-of-memory risk of loading multi-GB archives fully into a `Buffer`.
- **Configurable compression.** `BACKUP_ZIP_LEVEL` (default `6`) trades a little
  archive size for noticeably faster, less CPU-intensive zipping; set `9` for
  maximum compression or `1` for the fastest backups.
- **Batched git object checks.** Delta backups validate prior refs with a single
  `git cat-file --batch-check` process instead of one per ref.
- **Parallel fan-out.** Secondary-destination mirror uploads run concurrently.

The dashboard SPA is also tuned for fast loads: it ships **no web fonts** (system
UI stack), **`preconnect`/`dns-prefetch`** hints warm up the Firebase, Google
auth, GitHub, and Drive origins, inactive pages are `display:none` (skipped by
layout), and a cache-first **service worker** serves the app shell instantly on
repeat visits.

---

## Multi-Destination Fan-Out (3-2-1 Rule)

The 3-2-1 backup rule — **3** copies, on **2** different media, with **1** off-site — is the baseline for real resilience. This tool implements it by keeping Google Drive as the **primary** destination and mirroring every artifact to one or more **secondary** clouds.

![3-2-1 Fan-Out](docs/screenshots/fanout-321.svg)

Set `BACKUP_MIRROR_TARGETS` to any combination of `s3`, `azure`, and `b2` (each target's own credentials must also be configured):

```env
BACKUP_MIRROR_TARGETS=s3,b2
```

On each run the orchestrator mirrors:
- every repository archive (`repo.zip` / `repo.zip.enc`)
- every wiki archive
- per-repo `metadata.json`
- the session `manifest.json` and `backup-summary.json`

Each mirrored file's byte size is verified against the source. Mirroring is **best-effort**: a failed or mismatched mirror is logged and recorded under `summary.mirror.perTarget` (with `ok`/`failed` counts per destination) but never fails the primary Drive backup. Encrypted archives (`BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) are mirrored in their encrypted form.

---

## Backup Structure in Google Drive

```
GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID/
└── backup-2026-06-15T02-00-00-000Z/
    ├── backup-summary.json
    ├── repo-name/
    │   ├── repo-name.zip          — full git mirror (all branches + tags)
    │   ├── repo-name-wiki.zip     — wiki mirror (if repo has one)
    │   └── metadata.json          — issues, PRs, releases, labels, milestones
    └── ...
```

---

## Restore Behaviour

- Creates the target repo if it does not exist (private by default)
- Pushes all branches and tags with `--force` — safe to re-run
- Recreates labels and milestones exactly as backed up
- Issues and PRs are preserved in `metadata.json` — most git APIs do not support programmatic issue creation

---

## Cross-Provider Restore

A backup captured from GitHub isn't locked to GitHub. Because the archived git mirror carries the full history, it can be pushed to **any** git host — real disaster-recovery portability. Choose the destination when you dispatch the restore workflow (or set `RESTORE_TARGET_PROVIDER`):

![Cross-Provider Restore](docs/screenshots/cross-provider-restore.svg)

| Provider | `RESTORE_TARGET_PROVIDER` | Required secrets |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub *(default)* | `github` | `GH_BACKUP_TOKEN` |
| GitLab (SaaS or self-hosted) | `gitlab` | `GITLAB_TOKEN`, optional `GITLAB_HOST` (default `https://gitlab.com`) |
| Gitea (self-hosted) | `gitea` | `GITEA_TOKEN`, `GITEA_HOST` |
| Local disk (no push) | `local` | none — writes to `RESTORE_LOCAL_DIR` |

Each provider handles its own repo/project creation, authenticated remote URL, and label/milestone recreation (best-effort). The git push path is identical across providers, so branches and tags always transfer faithfully.

```bash
# Restore the latest session into a GitLab group
gh workflow run restore.yml \
  -f target_provider=gitlab \
  -f target_owner=my-gitlab-group
```

---

## True Delta Uploads (Incremental)

By default each session uploads a **full** zip mirror of every repo. With `INCREMENTAL_MODE=delta`, the backup instead uploads a **`git bundle` containing only the objects that are new since the last backup** — typically a fraction of the size for repos that change little between runs.

![Delta Uploads](docs/screenshots/delta-uploads.svg)

How it works per repo:

| Situation | What's uploaded |
|---|---|
| First-ever backup | `full` bundle (all objects) — the chain base |
| Refs changed since last session | `delta` bundle (`git bundle --all --not <prev tips>`) |
| No refs changed | **nothing** — the repo is skipped, only a tiny state file is written |
| History rewritten / force-push loses the base | automatic fall-back to a fresh `full` bundle |

Each repo folder stores a `backup-state.json` recording the ref SHAs plus the **chain** (`base` session + ordered deltas). Restore is fully automatic: it reads the chain, downloads the base bundle and each delta in order, and replays them to reconstruct the complete history before pushing — so a delta session is exactly as restorable as a full one. Encryption and 3-2-1 fan-out both apply to bundles just like zips.

> **Note:** the clone *from GitHub* is still a full mirror (needed to compute a correct delta); the savings are on **storage and upload bandwidth** — the cost that accrues over time on Drive/S3/B2.

```bash
gh workflow run backup.yml -f incremental_mode=delta
```

---

## Backup Retention & Cleanup

Configure automatic deletion of old sessions in **Settings → Retention**. Available periods: 30, 60, 90, 180 days, or 1 year.

The `cleanup.yml` workflow runs every Sunday at 03:00 UTC (or on demand). It paginates through all session folders in your Drive backup folder and deletes any created before the retention cutoff.

To trigger manually: **Settings → Retention → Run Cleanup Workflow**, or via Actions → Cleanup Old Backup Sessions → Run workflow.

---

## CLI Reference

```bash
npm run backup        # Back up all repos immediately
npm run restore       # Restore from the latest Drive session

## Failure Alerts & Notifications

`notify.yml` fires after every backup run and delivers rich, multi-channel notifications:

- **MS Teams** — color-coded Adaptive Card (green = success, red = failure). Set `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL`.
- **SendGrid email digest** — HTML table summarizing run status, repo count, and session link. Set `SENDGRID_API_KEY`.
- **Slack** — plain text message (legacy). Set `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`.
- **`docs/status.json`** — updated on every run; the dashboard overview reflects current status.

Additional proactive alerts:
- **PAT rotation reminder** (`pat-check.yml`, weekly Monday 08:00 UTC) — warns via Teams + email when `PAT_EXPIRY_DATE` is ≤7 days away.
- **SLA breach alert** (`sla-check.yml`, hourly) — fires Teams + email if backup age exceeds `SLA_HOURS` (default 26).
- **Monthly restore test** (`monthly-restore-test.yml`, 1st of month 03:00 UTC) — dry-run restore integrity check; result appended to `docs/audit.log`.

---

## Security & CI

### Source code protection
- **CODEOWNERS** — every file and workflow requires `@OmarRao` review before any PR can merge
- **Copyright headers** — `// Copyright (c) Omar Rao. All rights reserved.` is enforced on all 15 `src/**/*.js` files; CI fails if a new file is added without it
- `credentials/` and `.env` are in `.gitignore` — never committed
- Dashboard tokens stored in `localStorage` only — never sent to any third party

### CI pipeline (`ci.yml`) — runs on every push and PR to `main`

| Gate | Tool | Must pass |
|------|------|-----------|
| Copyright headers | shell `grep` across `src/` | Yes |
| Linting | ESLint (`no-eval`, `no-implied-eval`, `no-new-func`, `eqeqeq`) | Yes |
| Tests | Jest — 113 tests, 14 suites | Yes |
| Dependency audit | `npm audit --audit-level=high` | Warn |
| Workflow YAML | `yamllint` | Warn |
| Secret scanning | Gitleaks | Warn |
| Static analysis | CodeQL | Warn |
| Supply-chain posture | OpenSSF Scorecard | Warn |

```bash
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm test              # Jest with coverage
npm run check-headers # Copyright header audit
npm run audit         # npm audit --audit-level=high
```

### Runtime security
- GitHub PAT scopes: `repo`, `workflow`, `read:org`, `read:user` — read-only for backup, no destructive permissions
- Google Drive token scoped to `drive.file` in Actions, `drive.readonly` in the dashboard
- **Authenticated encryption at rest** — `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` archives use AES-256-GCM (integrity-checked; tampering is detected on restore). Legacy AES-256-CBC archives still decrypt for backward compatibility.
- **No shell, no secrets in argv** — all `git` calls use `execFileSync` with argument arrays (no shell interpolation → no command injection). The GitLab token is injected via `http.extraheader` (`GIT_CONFIG_*`), never placed in the clone URL or process arguments.
- **Status server hardening** — [helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) security headers, [express-rate-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit) (default 100 req / 15 min, tune with `API_RATE_LIMIT`), localhost binding by default (`HOST`), and an optional constant-time API-key guard on `/api` (`DASHBOARD_API_KEY`, compared with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`).
- **Dashboard CSP + escaping** — a restrictive `Content-Security-Policy` and HTML-escaping of all remote data mitigate XSS.

### Supply-chain hardening
- Every GitHub Action is **pinned to a full commit SHA** (with a `# vN` comment for Dependabot tracking).
- Dependency installs use `npm ci --ignore-scripts` (workflows, composite Action, and Docker image) to block install-time script execution.
- **OpenSSF Scorecard** (`scorecard.yml`) publishes supply-chain posture to the code-scanning dashboard; `npm audit` is kept at **0 known vulnerabilities**.

## Trust & Verification

A backup is only as good as its restore — so v5 makes recoverability and integrity **provable**.

![Trust & Distribution](docs/screenshots/trust-distribution.svg)

- **Signed manifests (Ed25519).** Set `BACKUP_SIGNING_KEY` (a PEM Ed25519 private key) and each session's `manifest.json` is signed to `manifest.json.sig`. On restore, set `BACKUP_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY` to verify it; SHA-256 catches *corruption*, the signature catches *tampering/forgery*. Set `BACKUP_REQUIRE_SIGNATURE=true` to abort a restore on a missing/invalid signature. Generate a keypair:
  ```bash
  node -e "const s=require('./src/lib/manifest-signing');const k=s.generateKeyPair();require('fs').writeFileSync('signing.key',k.privateKey);require('fs').writeFileSync('signing.pub',k.publicKey);console.log('wrote signing.key + signing.pub')"
  ```
- **Recovery scorecard.** The monthly restore drill (`monthly-restore-test.yml`) publishes `docs/recovery-scorecard.json` — *last verified restore + RTO* — shown as a dashboard tile. "Backups exist" becomes "restores are verified."
- **Tamper-evident audit log.** Audit entries (`src/audit/log.js`) are hash-chained: each carries the previous entry's SHA-256, so editing or deleting history is detectable via `verifyChain()`.

## Use as a GitHub Action

No fork required — compose it into any workflow:

```yaml
- uses: OmarRao/github-gdrive-backup@v5
  with:
    github-token:         ${{ secrets.GH_BACKUP_TOKEN }}
    gdrive-folder-id:     ${{ secrets.GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID }}
    google-client-secret: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET }}
    google-token:         ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_TOKEN }}
    incremental-mode:     delta        # optional
    mirror-targets:       s3,b2        # optional 3-2-1 fan-out
    signing-key:          ${{ secrets.BACKUP_SIGNING_KEY }}   # optional
```

See [`action.yml`](action.yml) for all inputs. The action outputs a JSON `summary` (totals, delta composition, fan-out, signature).

## Self-Hosted Runners

All three workflows (backup, restore, cleanup) support self-hosted runners. When dispatching manually, set the **Runner label** input to your runner's label (e.g. `self-hosted` or `my-mac-mini`).

Self-hosted runners are useful when you need:
- Faster network access to your GitHub Enterprise instance
- Pre-installed tools (e.g. `syft` for SBOM generation)
- Custom credentials storage

---

## GitLab Source

Back up GitLab projects alongside GitHub repos. Set these GitHub Actions secrets:

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `GITLAB_TOKEN` | GitLab personal access token with `read_api` and `read_repository` scopes |

Optionally set `GITLAB_HOST` if you use a self-hosted GitLab instance (default: `https://gitlab.com`).

When dispatching the backup workflow manually, enter your token in the **GitLab Token** input. GitLab repos are uploaded with a `gitlab-` filename prefix to the same Drive session folder.

---

## Backup Encryption

Set the `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` GitHub Actions secret to a 32-byte hex string (64 hex characters) to enable **authenticated AES-256-GCM** encryption of all backup zips.

Generate a key:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

When encryption is enabled, backup files are stored as `.zip.enc` instead of `.zip`. New archives use the format `GCM1 | 12-byte IV | ciphertext | 16-byte auth tag`; the authentication tag is verified on restore, so any tampering (or a wrong key) is **detected and rejected** rather than silently producing corrupt data. Archives created by earlier versions (AES-256-CBC: `16-byte IV | ciphertext`) are still decrypted automatically. The restore workflow decrypts files whenever `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set.
