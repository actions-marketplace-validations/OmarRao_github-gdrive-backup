## 1. Introduction

The **GitHub → Google Drive Backup** project is an automated, self-hostable backup solution that mirrors your GitHub repositories — including code, branches, tags, issues, pull-request metadata, releases, and wikis — into Google Drive on a recurring schedule. It is designed for individuals, teams, and organizations who treat their source control history as a critical business asset and want an independent, off-platform copy that survives accidental deletion, account compromise, or a GitHub-side outage.

Everything in the project is driven by **GitHub Actions**, which means there is no server to maintain, no cron host to patch, and no standing infrastructure cost beyond the free Actions minutes most accounts already have. The canonical repository is **`OmarRao/github-gdrive-backup`**, and the public dashboard is published via GitHub Pages at **https://omarrao.github.io/github-gdrive-backup/**. The backup job runs **daily at 02:00 UTC** by default and can also be triggered on demand.

The companion **dashboard** is a static single-page application that requires no backend of its own. It talks directly to `api.github.com` and `googleapis.com` from the browser, using tokens that never leave your machine. From the dashboard you can browse repositories, kick off and monitor backups, perform point-in-time restores, review reports, and export compliance evidence. As of **version 2.1.0**, the dashboard also supports **Firebase Google Sign-In** and a fully self-contained **Demo Mode** that lets anyone explore the interface with sample data and zero configuration.

This guide is the flagship reference for the project. It walks through architecture, first-time setup, day-to-day dashboard usage, the backup and restore lifecycle, storage and retention strategy, monitoring, security hardening, command-line and Docker usage, self-hosted runners, and compliance reporting. Where a capability is fully implemented it is described as such; where a capability is **optional or aspirational** (for example, Slack notifications, email digests, or Azure Blob storage), that status is called out explicitly so you can plan accordingly.

Throughout the document, the three core workflows — **`backup.yml`**, **`restore.yml`**, and **`cleanup.yml`** — are referenced by name. These live under `.github/workflows/` in your fork and represent the backup pipeline, the restore pipeline, and the retention/cleanup pipeline respectively. Understanding what each does, and which secrets each consumes, is the key to operating the system confidently.

---

## 2. Architecture Overview

At a high level, the system has three cooperating layers: the **automation layer** (GitHub Actions workflows), the **storage layer** (Google Drive, optionally S3 or Azure Blob), and the **presentation layer** (the static dashboard hosted on GitHub Pages). None of these layers requires a dedicated server — the workflows run on GitHub-hosted (or optionally self-hosted) runners, and the dashboard is plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript served as static files.

The **automation layer** is the engine. On a schedule, or on manual dispatch, `backup.yml` checks out the tooling, authenticates to GitHub using `GH_BACKUP_TOKEN`, enumerates the repositories owned by `GH_USER` (and any additional organizations you configure), clones or fetches each one as a mirror, packages it, optionally encrypts it, and uploads the resulting archive into the Google Drive folder identified by `GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID`. The `restore.yml` workflow reverses this process for a chosen point-in-time session, and `cleanup.yml` enforces the retention policy by pruning archives older than your configured window.

![Dashboard Overview](screenshots/dashboard.svg)

The **storage layer** is Google Drive by default. Authentication to Drive uses an OAuth client (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`) plus a refresh-capable token (`GOOGLE_TOKEN`) that you generate once locally with the `get_token.py` helper. Each backup run writes into a per-session, per-repository folder hierarchy so that any single run can be located and restored independently. For organizations that prefer object storage or need geographic redundancy, the project also supports **Amazon S3** (`STORAGE_TARGET=s3`), **Azure Blob Storage** (`STORAGE_TARGET=azure`), and **Backblaze B2** (`STORAGE_TARGET=b2`) as fully implemented storage backends. Beyond a single target, **multi-destination fan-out** (`BACKUP_MIRROR_TARGETS`) mirrors every archive to additional clouds to satisfy the 3-2-1 backup rule — see [8.2A](#82a-multi-destination-fan-out-3-2-1-rule).

The **presentation layer** — the dashboard — is intentionally "thin." It holds no secrets server-side because there is no server. Your GitHub PAT and Drive token are stored exclusively in the browser's `localStorage`, and the only outbound calls the dashboard makes are to `api.github.com` and `googleapis.com`. This design keeps the trust boundary tight: GitHub Pages serves static files, your browser holds your credentials, and the third-party APIs do the work. Firebase, when configured, is used only for sign-in identity and never receives your backup tokens.

The diagram below summarizes the request flow across layers:

```text
        ┌──────────────────────┐
        │   Browser (you)      │
        │  dashboard SPA       │
        │  localStorage tokens │
        └──────────┬───────────┘
                   │ HTTPS (api.github.com, googleapis.com)
                   ▼
  ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ GitHub Actions (backup/restore/cleanup) │
  │   GH_BACKUP_TOKEN, GOOGLE_TOKEN, ...     │
  └───────────────┬─────────────────────────┘
                  │ clone/fetch        │ upload/download
                  ▼                    ▼
          api.github.com        Google Drive / S3 / Azure
```

A central design principle is **least standing state**: the only durable artifacts are your encrypted-or-plain archives in cloud storage and your secrets in the GitHub repository's encrypted secret store. Everything else — runner VMs, dashboard sessions, temporary clones — is ephemeral and reconstructed on demand.

---

## 3. Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have accounts and tooling for each layer of the system. You will need a **GitHub account** with permission to fork repositories and to create a Personal Access Token (PAT). If you intend to back up organization repositories, you will also need at least read access to those organizations. A **Google account** with Google Drive is required for the default storage target, along with the ability to create a project in the **Google Cloud Console** so you can issue OAuth credentials.

On your local machine you should have **Python 3.9+** and **Git** installed, since the one-time token generation step (`get_token.py`) runs locally. The optional `gh` (GitHub CLI) tool is strongly recommended because it makes setting repository secrets a one-line operation. If you plan to use Docker or self-hosted runners, you will additionally need **Docker** installed and, for runners, a host you control.

The table below summarizes prerequisites by capability:

| Capability | Requirement | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub backup source | GitHub account + PAT (`GH_BACKUP_TOKEN`) | Yes |
| Google Drive storage | Google account, Cloud project, OAuth client | Yes (default target) |
| One-time token auth | Python 3.9+, Git, `get_token.py` | Yes |
| Setting secrets easily | GitHub CLI (`gh`) | Recommended |
| Encryption | An AES-256 key for `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Optional |
| S3 storage | AWS account + access keys | Optional |
| Azure Blob storage | Azure account + connection string | Optional / aspirational |
| Dashboard sign-in | Firebase project + web app config | Optional |
| Self-hosted runner | A host with Docker / runner agent | Optional |

You should also decide up front on a few policy questions that affect setup: which repositories and organizations are in scope, whether backups must be encrypted at rest, what your retention window should be, and whether you require an SLA on backup freshness. These choices map directly onto secrets and dashboard settings covered later. Finally, ensure your GitHub Actions minutes quota is sufficient for the number and size of repositories you plan to back up daily; very large monorepos consume more clone time and storage.

---

## 4. Initial Setup

This section takes you from zero to a working daily backup. Work through the subsections in order. At the end you will have a fork of the project, a Google Drive destination wired up via OAuth, a GitHub PAT, all required Actions secrets set, and — optionally — Firebase sign-in enabled on your dashboard.

### 4.1 Fork the repository

Start by forking **`OmarRao/github-gdrive-backup`** into your own account or organization. Forking (rather than cloning to a fresh repo) preserves the workflow files and the GitHub Pages configuration so the dashboard is published automatically from your fork.

```bash
# Option A: fork via the GitHub CLI
gh repo fork OmarRao/github-gdrive-backup --clone=true
cd github-gdrive-backup

# Option B: clone your fork after forking in the web UI
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/github-gdrive-backup.git
cd github-gdrive-backup
```

After forking, enable GitHub Actions on the fork (the **Actions** tab will prompt you to enable workflows on forks) and enable GitHub Pages from the `docs/` folder on the default branch so your dashboard is served at `https://<your-user>.github.io/github-gdrive-backup/`. Confirm the three workflows — `backup.yml`, `restore.yml`, and `cleanup.yml` — appear under the Actions tab before continuing.

### 4.2 Google Cloud Setup

Google Drive access uses OAuth 2.0. In the **Google Cloud Console**, create (or reuse) a project, enable the **Google Drive API**, and create an **OAuth client ID** of type *Desktop app*. Download the resulting JSON and save it locally as `credentials/google-client-secret.json` — this file's contents become the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` secret.

Next, create the Drive folder that will hold backups and copy its folder ID from the URL (the long string after `/folders/`). That value becomes `GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID`. Then run the one-time authorization helper to mint a long-lived token:

```bash
# One-time interactive auth — opens a browser, you approve Drive access
python get_token.py
# Produces: credentials/google-token.json
```

`get_token.py` performs the OAuth consent flow and writes `credentials/google-token.json`. The contents of that file become the `GOOGLE_TOKEN` secret. Because the token is refresh-capable, you only need to run this once unless you revoke access or the refresh token expires. Keep both JSON files out of version control — they are listed in `.gitignore` and should never be committed.

### 4.3 GitHub Token

The backup workflow authenticates to GitHub with a **Personal Access Token** stored as `GH_BACKUP_TOKEN`. Create a classic PAT (or a fine-grained token with equivalent access) carrying the scopes below. These scopes let the workflow enumerate and clone your repositories, read organization membership, and dispatch workflows.

| Scope | Why it is needed |
|---|---|
| `repo` | Clone private and public repositories, read metadata |
| `workflow` | Allow workflow dispatch / management from automation |
| `read:org` | Enumerate organization repositories for multi-org backup |
| `read:user` | Resolve the authenticated user and profile details |

Store the token value securely; you will paste it into the secrets in the next step. Treat this PAT as highly sensitive — it can read all your code. Prefer the shortest practical expiry and rotate it on a schedule (see [Security](#10-security)).

### 4.4 Configure GitHub Secrets

All credentials are stored as **encrypted GitHub Actions secrets** on your fork. The dashboard never sets these for you — they live in your repository's secret store and are only decrypted inside the runner at execution time. The fastest way to set them is the GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Core secrets
gh secret set GH_BACKUP_TOKEN          # paste your PAT
gh secret set GH_USER       --body "your-github-username"
gh secret set GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID --body "1AbCdEf...your-folder-id"

# Google OAuth (read JSON straight from the files you created)
gh secret set GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET < credentials/google-client-secret.json
gh secret set GOOGLE_TOKEN         < credentials/google-token.json

# Optional: authenticated encryption at rest (AES-256-GCM -> files stored as .zip.enc)
gh secret set BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY --body "$(openssl rand -hex 32)"

# Optional: Amazon S3 as the storage target
gh secret set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     --body "AKIA..."
gh secret set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY --body "..."
# and add a repository variable / secret STORAGE_TARGET=s3
```

The complete secret reference is below. Only the first five are required for a default Google Drive backup; the rest enable optional capabilities.

| Secret | Purpose | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| `GH_BACKUP_TOKEN` | PAT with `repo, workflow, read:org, read:user` | Yes |
| `GH_USER` | GitHub username whose repos are backed up | Yes |
| `GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID` | Destination Google Drive folder ID | Yes |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | JSON of `credentials/google-client-secret.json` | Yes |
| `GOOGLE_TOKEN` | JSON of `credentials/google-token.json` (from `get_token.py`) | Yes |
| `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | AES-256-GCM key (64 hex chars); archives stored as `.zip.enc` | Optional |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | S3 access key (with `STORAGE_TARGET=s3`) | Optional |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | S3 secret key (with `STORAGE_TARGET=s3`) | Optional |
| `AWS_BUCKET_NAME` | S3 bucket name (with `STORAGE_TARGET=s3`) | Optional |
| `AWS_REGION` | S3 region, e.g. `us-east-1` (with `STORAGE_TARGET=s3`) | Optional |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | S3 secret key (with `STORAGE_TARGET=s3`) | Optional |

After setting secrets, you can verify them from the **Settings → Actions Secrets** tab of the dashboard, which shows which expected secrets are present (it never displays values — only presence). You can also confirm with `gh secret list`.

### 4.5 Firebase Authentication (optional)

By default the dashboard offers **Demo Mode** with no login. If you want real Google Sign-In so only authorized users can drive live backups from the UI, configure **Firebase**. Create a Firebase project, add a **Web App**, enable the **Google** sign-in provider under Authentication, and copy the web config object.

The dashboard reads a placeholder named `FIREBASE_CONFIG` inside `docs/index.html`. Replace the placeholder with your real values:

```js
// docs/index.html — fill in to enable Google Sign-In
const FIREBASE_CONFIG = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyD...your-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789012",
  appId: "1:123456789012:web:abcdef123456"
};
```

If `FIREBASE_CONFIG` is left as the placeholder, sign-in is unavailable and **only Demo Mode** is offered — this is by design, so an unconfigured fork still produces a usable, explorable dashboard. Once filled in, the **Sign in with Google** button appears, and authenticated identity gates the live action buttons. Remember that Firebase only establishes *who you are*; it never stores or transmits your GitHub PAT or Drive token, which remain in `localStorage`.

---

## 5. Dashboard Guide

The dashboard is the primary human interface to the system. It is a static SPA, so it loads instantly, works offline for read-only exploration in Demo Mode, and keeps your credentials on your device. This section covers signing in, navigating, reading the overview, theming, and keyboard control.

### 5.1 Login & Demo Mode

When you open the dashboard you are presented with two paths. If Firebase is configured (see [4.5](#45-firebase-authentication-optional)), you can **Sign in with Google** to unlock live features tied to your tokens. If Firebase is not configured, or you simply want to look around, choose **Try Demo** / **Explore with sample data**.

![Demo Mode](screenshots/demo-mode.svg)

**Demo Mode** loads a realistic set of sample data — 5 repositories and **30 daily backup sessions** — so you can experience the full UI without any setup. Every number on screen (stat cards, storage-growth chart, timeline heatmap, delta composition, fan-out status, success rate, streak) is **derived from that single dataset**, so the demo is always internally consistent rather than showing hard-coded figures that contradict the graphs. A persistent **yellow banner** makes it obvious you are in demo mode, no real API calls are made, and any live action button shows a **"Sign in to use live features"** toast instead of acting.

### 5.1A First-Run Setup & Dashboard Gating

On your **first real sign-in**, the dashboard does not yet have your GitHub token or Drive connection — so it deliberately **does not fetch or display any data**. Instead of showing zeros, stale figures, or (worse) the upstream template's data, every stat renders as `—` and a **setup checklist** appears:

![First-Run Setup](screenshots/onboarding.svg)

The checklist tracks four steps — **GitHub token**, **GitHub account** (auto-verified from the token), **Google Drive connection**, and **backup folder ID** — each linking straight to the relevant Settings section, with a live progress bar. You can **Skip for now** to explore, and it reappears (until complete) whenever you return to the Dashboard. The dashboard only begins fetching live stats once all four are done.

**Fork-aware targeting.** The dashboard automatically determines which repository to talk to from its own GitHub Pages URL (`https://<you>.github.io/<repo>/` → `<you>/<repo>`), so **every fork's dashboard shows its own live data**, never the upstream's. When running locally or on custom hosting it falls back to a configurable owner/name (`gh_repo_owner` / `gh_repo_name` in `localStorage`).

### 5.2 Navigation

The left navigation (or top tab bar on smaller screens) exposes the main areas: **Dashboard**, **Backup**, **Restore**, **Workflow Runs**, **Reports**, and **Settings**. Each area is a distinct view; switching between them does not reload the page. The same areas are reachable instantly via keyboard shortcuts (see [5.5](#55-keyboard-shortcuts)).

Within **Settings**, a set of sub-tabs organizes configuration: GitHub, Storage (including S3), Actions Secrets, the Setup Guide wizard, Accounts/multi-org, Retention, Access Control allow-list, SLA, and Security. The Setup Guide wizard is the friendliest entry point for first-time users, walking through token entry and destination selection step by step.

### 5.3 Dashboard Overview

The Dashboard view summarizes system health at a glance through four stat cards: **Repositories** (how many repos are in scope), **Backup Sessions** (count of recorded backup runs), **Last Backup** (timestamp of the most recent successful run, annotated with an **SLA badge** that turns from green to amber to red as freshness degrades), and **Active Runs** (workflows currently executing).

![Reports](screenshots/reports.svg)

Below the cards, the **Reports** tab provides deeper analytics: an overall **success rate**, a current **streak** of consecutive successful days, a **bar chart** of runs over time, per-repository **sparklines**, a searchable **audit log**, **CSV export** of raw history, and a **Compliance PDF export** for evidence packages. Together these views let an operator confirm in seconds that backups are current and healthy, or pinpoint exactly when and where something went wrong.

### 5.4 Dark Mode

The dashboard ships with a **dark mode** toggle in the header. Your preference is persisted in `localStorage`, so the choice survives reloads and is per-browser. Dark mode adjusts the entire palette — cards, charts, tables, and the audit log — for low-light environments and reduced eye strain during long monitoring sessions. The toggle does not affect any data or behavior; it is purely presentational.

### 5.5 Keyboard Shortcuts

Power users can drive the dashboard almost entirely from the keyboard. The single-key shortcuts below jump directly to a view or open help; `Esc` closes any open modal or panel.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `D` | Go to Dashboard |
| `B` | Go to Backup |
| `R` | Go to Restore |
| `W` | Go to Workflow Runs |
| `P` | Go to Reports |
| `S` | Go to Settings |
| `?` | Open keyboard shortcuts / help |
| `Esc` | Close the current modal or panel |

Shortcuts are disabled while typing in a text field, so they never interfere with entering a token or a repository name. Press `?` at any time to bring up the full reference overlay.

---

## 6. Running Backups

Backups are the heart of the system. They can run automatically on a schedule, on demand from the dashboard or the Actions UI, and in several modes (incremental, multi-org, GitLab source, encrypted). This section covers each.

### 6.1 Scheduled Backups

Out of the box, `backup.yml` runs **daily at 02:00 UTC** via a cron trigger. This cadence balances freshness against Actions minutes and Drive churn for most users. The schedule is defined in the workflow's `on.schedule` block:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 2 * * *"   # daily at 02:00 UTC
  workflow_dispatch: {}    # also allow manual runs
```

To change the cadence, edit the cron expression (for example `0 */6 * * *` for every six hours) and commit. Remember that GitHub schedules are best-effort and may be delayed during periods of high load; the **SLA badge** on the dashboard will surface any drift in backup freshness.

![Backup](screenshots/backup.svg)

### 6.2 Manual Backup

You can trigger a backup any time. From the dashboard **Backup** tab, choose the repositories to include, set your options, and start the run; the dashboard dispatches the workflow via the GitHub API using your PAT. From GitHub directly, use the Actions UI or the CLI:

```bash
# Trigger a manual backup run via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run backup.yml

# Or with inputs, if your backup.yml declares workflow_dispatch inputs:
gh workflow run backup.yml \
  -f repos="repo-a,repo-b" \
  -f encrypt=true
```

A corresponding `workflow_dispatch` definition in `backup.yml` makes those inputs available:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      repos:
        description: "Comma-separated repos (blank = all)"
        required: false
        default: ""
      encrypt:
        description: "Encrypt archives at rest"
        type: boolean
        default: false
```

After dispatch, follow progress live in the **Workflow Runs** view.

### 6.3 Incremental Backups

Because each repository is fetched as a **git mirror**, the system naturally captures full history while transferring only changed objects on subsequent runs — git's pack protocol sends deltas, not the whole repository each time. This means day-to-day runs are fast and bandwidth-efficient even though every session yields a self-contained, restorable archive. For very large repositories, incremental fetch dramatically reduces clone time compared with a fresh full clone on every run.

If you enable encryption, note that each archive is encrypted independently, so an incremental fetch still produces a complete, decryptable `.zip.enc` per session rather than a chain of dependent diffs. This keeps restore simple: any single session stands on its own.

### 6.3A True Delta Uploads (`INCREMENTAL_MODE=delta`)

The default archive is a **full** zip mirror per session. Setting `INCREMENTAL_MODE=delta` (or the `incremental_mode: delta` workflow input) switches to **true delta uploads**: each session uploads a `git bundle` containing *only the objects new since the last backup*, dramatically reducing storage and upload bandwidth for repos that change little between runs.

![Delta Uploads](screenshots/delta-uploads.svg)

Per repo, the engine (`src/backup/incremental.js`) compares the current ref → SHA map against the previous session's state and chooses:

| Decision | Bundle written |
|---|---|
| No previous state | `full` bundle (`git bundle --all`) — the chain base |
| Refs changed | `delta` bundle (`git bundle --all --not <prev tips>`) |
| Refs identical | **unchanged** — no archive uploaded, only a small `backup-state.json` |
| Previous base objects missing (force-push / history rewrite) | automatic fall-back to a fresh `full` bundle |

Each repo folder stores `backup-state.json` recording the ref SHAs and the **chain** — the base session plus the ordered list of delta sessions. On restore, `src/restore/index.js` reads the chain, downloads the base bundle and every delta in order, and replays them (`git clone --mirror` of the base, then `git fetch` of each delta) to reconstruct the complete history before pushing. A delta session is therefore exactly as restorable as a full one, on any provider (see [7.4](#74-cross-provider-restore-github--gitlab--gitea)).

**What is and isn't saved.** The clone *from GitHub* remains a full mirror — that is required to compute a correct delta locally. The savings are on **storage and upload bandwidth** (Drive/S3/B2), which is the cost that accumulates session-over-session. Encryption and 3-2-1 fan-out apply to bundles exactly as they do to zips (`<repo>.bundle` / `<repo>.bundle.enc`).

```bash
gh workflow run backup.yml -f incremental_mode=delta
```

The session `backup-summary.json` reports the outcome mix under `incremental`, e.g. `{ "mode": "delta", "full": 2, "delta": 46, "unchanged": 11 }`.

### 6.4 Multi-Org Backup

Beyond your personal account (`GH_USER`), you can back up repositories across multiple organizations. In the dashboard **Backup** tab there is a **multi-org input** where you list the organizations to include; the corresponding **Accounts/multi-org** settings tab persists this configuration. The PAT's `read:org` scope is what allows enumeration of organization repositories.

```bash
# Example: dispatch a multi-org backup
gh workflow run backup.yml \
  -f orgs="acme-inc,acme-labs" \
  -f repos=""               # blank = all repos in those orgs
```

Each organization's repositories are placed under their own owner path in the Drive structure (see [8.1](#81-google-drive-structure)) so that ownership is preserved and restores can target the correct destination.

### 6.5 GitLab Source

In addition to GitHub, the **Backup** tab exposes a **GitLab token source** field, allowing repositories hosted on GitLab to be included in the same backup pipeline. Provide a GitLab personal access token with read access, and the workflow clones the specified GitLab projects alongside your GitHub repositories. This is useful for teams that span both platforms and want a single retention and reporting surface.

GitLab support is treated as an **optional/extended source**: enable it only if you maintain GitLab projects. When no GitLab token is supplied, the field is simply ignored and the pipeline runs GitHub-only.

### 6.6 Backup Encryption

For encryption at rest, set the optional `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` secret (a 32-byte key as 64 hex characters). When present, archives are encrypted with **authenticated AES-256-GCM** and stored with a `.zip.enc` extension instead of `.zip`. You can toggle encryption per run from the **Backup** tab's include/encryption options, or default it on via the workflow input.

```bash
# Generate a strong key (64 hex chars) and store it as a secret
gh secret set BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY --body "$(openssl rand -hex 32)"

# Decrypt an archive locally when needed, using the project's own helper.
# (The GCM format carries a magic header, IV, and auth tag, so a plain
#  `openssl enc` command cannot decrypt it; the restore workflow does this
#  for you automatically.)
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<your-hex-key> node -e "
  require('./src/lib/archive-crypto')
    .decryptFile('repo-a.zip.enc', 'repo-a.zip', process.env.BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY)
    .then(() => console.log('decrypted'));
"
```

**Important:** the encryption key is the only thing that can decrypt your archives. If you lose it, the backups are unrecoverable — store it in a password manager or secrets vault in addition to the GitHub secret. Rotating the key affects only future runs; archives written under an old key still require that old key to decrypt.

---

## 7. Restore Guide

Restores bring data back from storage. The `restore.yml` workflow downloads a chosen session's archives, decrypts them if necessary, and re-creates repositories at a target owner. The dashboard **Restore** tab makes this a guided, low-risk operation with point-in-time selection and a dry-run safety net.

### 7.1 Selecting a Session (Point-in-Time)

Every backup run is recorded as a discrete **session** stamped with its timestamp. In the **Restore** tab you choose the exact session you want to restore from — this is **point-in-time recovery**. Because sessions are independent, you can restore yesterday's state, last week's, or any retained session without affecting the others.

![Restore](screenshots/restore.svg)

Select the session, then choose which repositories within it to restore (all, or a subset). The dashboard shows the session's contents so you can confirm you are recovering the right point in time before proceeding.

### 7.2 Dry-Run Mode

Before performing a real restore, run a **dry-run**. The Restore tab offers a dry-run toggle that exercises the entire pipeline — locating the session, validating archives, decrypting (in memory/scratch), and planning destination repositories — **without writing anything** to GitHub. This is the safe way to confirm that credentials, the chosen session, and the target owner are all correct.

```bash
# Dispatch a dry-run restore from the CLI
gh workflow run restore.yml \
  -f session="2026-06-25T02:00Z" \
  -f target_owner="your-user" \
  -f dry_run=true
```

Review the dry-run output in **Workflow Runs**. Only when it reports a clean plan should you proceed to a full restore.

### 7.3 Full Restore

A full restore writes the selected repositories back to the **target owner** you specify. The target owner can be your original account/org or a different destination (useful for migrations or for restoring into a sandbox to verify integrity without touching production).

```bash
# Full restore into a target owner
gh workflow run restore.yml \
  -f session="2026-06-25T02:00Z" \
  -f target_owner="your-user" \
  -f repos="repo-a,repo-b" \
  -f dry_run=false
```

Restored repositories are pushed from the mirror, recreating branches and tags. If archives were encrypted, `restore.yml` uses `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to decrypt them transparently — so that secret must still be present at restore time. After a restore completes, verify the result in GitHub and, ideally, compare a known commit hash against the source to confirm fidelity.

### 7.4 Cross-Provider Restore (GitHub / GitLab / Gitea)

Because each archive is a complete git mirror, a backup is **not tied to the source host**. You can restore into a different git provider entirely — the foundation of a real disaster-recovery and vendor-portability story. The destination is selected by `RESTORE_TARGET_PROVIDER` (or the `target_provider` workflow input); `restore/providers/` encapsulates the per-provider differences (repo creation, authenticated remote URL, label/milestone APIs) behind a common interface, so the git push path is identical everywhere.

![Cross-Provider Restore](screenshots/cross-provider-restore.svg)

| Provider | `RESTORE_TARGET_PROVIDER` | Secrets | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GitHub *(default)* | `github` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Original behavior; fully backward compatible |
| GitLab | `gitlab` | `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_HOST` (default `https://gitlab.com`) | SaaS or self-hosted; creates the project under the target namespace |
| Gitea | `gitea` | `GITEA_TOKEN`, `GITEA_HOST` | Self-hosted; tries the org endpoint, falls back to the user namespace |

```bash
# Restore the latest session into a self-hosted GitLab group
gh workflow run restore.yml \
  -f target_provider=gitlab \
  -f target_owner=platform-team \
  -f repos="api-service,webapp-frontend"
```

**What transfers:** all branches and tags (force-pushed from the mirror), plus labels and milestones recreated via the destination's API on a best-effort basis. Issues and pull requests remain in `metadata.json` for reference — cross-host issue re-creation is intentionally out of scope because issue/PR models differ between providers. Encrypted archives are decrypted with `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` before push, exactly as in a same-provider restore.

---

## 8. Storage & Retention

This section describes where backups live, how the folder layout is organized, the optional object-storage targets, how old data is pruned, and how to keep an eye on Drive capacity.

### 8.1 Google Drive Structure

Backups are written under the folder identified by `GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID` using a predictable, session-and-owner oriented hierarchy. This layout makes any single run easy to locate, and keeps owners (your account and any organizations) cleanly separated.

```text
<GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID>/
├── 2026-06-25T02-00Z/              # session (timestamp)
│   ├── your-user/
│   │   ├── repo-a.zip(.enc)
│   │   └── repo-b.zip(.enc)
│   └── acme-inc/
│       └── service-x.zip(.enc)
├── 2026-06-26T02-00Z/
│   └── ...
└── manifests/
    └── 2026-06-26T02-00Z.json      # session manifest (contents, hashes)
```

Each session optionally carries a **manifest** describing its contents and integrity hashes, which the restore and reporting flows use to validate completeness.

### 8.2 S3 / Azure Blob / Backblaze B2

Set `STORAGE_TARGET` to choose your storage backend. The same session/owner key structure applies across all targets.

| Target | `STORAGE_TARGET` value | Secrets required | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Google Drive | *(default — omit the variable)* | `GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID`, Google OAuth | Implemented (default) |
| Amazon S3 | `s3` | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_BUCKET_NAME`, `AWS_REGION` | Implemented |
| Azure Blob Storage | `azure` | `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`, `AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME` | Implemented (`src/backup/storage/azure.js`) |
| Backblaze B2 | `b2` | `B2_ENDPOINT`, `B2_KEY_ID`, `B2_APP_KEY`, `B2_BUCKET` | Implemented (`src/backup/storage/b2.js`) |

**Azure Blob** uses `@azure/storage-blob` (lazy-loaded only when `STORAGE_TARGET=azure`). The container is created automatically on first use if it does not exist. **Backblaze B2** reuses `@aws-sdk/client-s3` with your B2 S3-compatible endpoint — no additional SDK install required beyond the existing AWS SDK dependency.

### 8.2A Multi-Destination Fan-Out (3-2-1 Rule)

`STORAGE_TARGET` chooses a *single* primary backend. For true resilience, the **3-2-1 rule** calls for three copies across two media with one off-site. The fan-out layer (`src/backup/storage/fanout.js`) delivers this by keeping **Google Drive as the primary destination** and *mirroring* every artifact to one or more secondary clouds.

![3-2-1 Fan-Out](screenshots/fanout-321.svg)

Enable it with a comma-separated list of adapters:

```env
BACKUP_MIRROR_TARGETS=s3,b2
```

Valid values are `s3`, `azure`, and `b2`. Each listed target's own credentials (see the table in [8.2](#82-s3--azure-blob--backblaze-b2)) must also be present. On every run the orchestrator mirrors:

- each repository archive (`<repo>.zip` or `<repo>.zip.enc`)
- each wiki archive (`<repo>-wiki.zip`)
- each per-repo `metadata.json` (mirrored as `<repo>-metadata.json` in the flat session prefix)
- the session-level `manifest.json` and `backup-summary.json`

**Verification & failure semantics.** Each mirrored file's reported byte size is checked against the source; a mismatch is logged as an error and marked `ok: false`. Mirroring is **best-effort** — a mirror failure never fails the primary Drive backup. Results are aggregated into the summary under `mirror.perTarget`, e.g.:

```json
"mirror": {
  "targets": ["s3", "b2"],
  "perTarget": { "s3": { "ok": 12, "failed": 0 }, "b2": { "ok": 11, "failed": 1 } }
}
```

**Encryption.** When `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set, archives are mirrored in their already-encrypted (`.zip.enc`) form, so secondary copies are protected at rest just like the primary.

### 8.3 Retention Policy (age-based)

`cleanup.yml` applies **simple age-based retention**: any session older than
`RETENTION_DAYS` (default **21**) is deleted. It runs weekly on the **Sunday
03:00 UTC** schedule, or on demand. Authentication uses the same **OAuth refresh
token** as backup and restore (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` + `GOOGLE_TOKEN`).

**Chain-aware safety.** Deletion is age-based but never blindly destructive: the
pure `planCleanup()` function first reads the `backup-state.json` of every
*retained* session and protects the entire delta chain each one depends on, so an
old **base** or intermediate bundle is never removed while a newer session still
needs it to restore (see [15B](#15b-reliability--operations-v35)). Protected-but-old
sessions are logged explicitly.

To dispatch with a custom window:

```bash
gh workflow run cleanup.yml -f retention_days=30
```

Choose a window that satisfies your recovery objectives and compliance
requirements (see [Section 14](#14-compliance--reporting)).

### 8.4 Drive Quota Monitoring

Because Google Drive has a finite quota, the system surfaces capacity awareness in the dashboard so you are not surprised by a full drive. Keep an eye on storage growth, especially if you back up many large repositories daily with a long retention window. If you approach your quota, options include shortening retention, enabling encryption-aware compression, moving to S3, or upgrading your Google storage plan. Monitoring quota proactively prevents the silent failure mode where new uploads start to fail because the destination is full.

---

## 9. Notifications & Monitoring

Knowing that backups succeeded — and being alerted promptly when they do not — is essential for a backup system you can trust. The dashboard provides built-in monitoring; all outbound notification channels are fully implemented and activated by setting the corresponding secret.

### 9.1 Slack Webhook

Set `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` as a GitHub Actions secret to receive plain-text Slack messages on backup failure. If the secret is absent, the step is skipped automatically.

```yaml
- name: Notify Slack
  if: failure()
  run: |
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
      --data "{\"text\":\"Backup FAILED — ${{ github.run_id }}\"}" \
      "${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}"
```

### 9.2 Email Digest (SendGrid)

Set `SENDGRID_API_KEY` to activate the HTML email digest that fires in `notify.yml` after every backup run. The email includes a status table (repo count, run URL, duration, conclusion), delivered via the SendGrid REST API — no SMTP server required. The step is skipped automatically when the secret is absent.

```bash
gh secret set SENDGRID_API_KEY --body "SG...."
```

The digest email uses `omarsrao@gmail.com` as both the `From` and `To` address (configured in `notify.yml`).

### 9.3 MS Teams Webhook

Set `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` to receive an Adaptive Card in a Teams channel after each run. Green cards indicate success; red cards indicate failure. The card body includes the conclusion, workflow run URL, repository count, and a direct link to the run logs.

```bash
gh secret set TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL --body "https://your-tenant.webhook.office.com/..."
```

The step uses `continue-on-error: true` so a Teams outage never blocks a backup run.

### 9.4 PAT Rotation Reminder

`pat-check.yml` runs every **Monday at 08:00 UTC**. Set the `PAT_EXPIRY_DATE` secret (format `YYYY-MM-DD`) to your PAT's expiry date:

```bash
gh secret set PAT_EXPIRY_DATE --body "2026-09-30"
```

Behavior:
- **≤7 days remaining** — posts an amber warning Adaptive Card to Teams + sends a SendGrid email.
- **Already expired** — posts a red critical card to Teams + sends a SendGrid email.
- **Secret absent** — workflow exits cleanly with no error.

This ensures you are never caught off-guard by a silent auth failure from an expired PAT.

### 9.5 SLA Breach Alerts

`sla-check.yml` runs **every hour**. It reads `docs/status.json` from the repository, checks the `last_run` timestamp, and compares it against the `SLA_HOURS` secret (default: `26` hours — one hour of grace beyond the 24-hour daily window).

```bash
gh secret set SLA_HOURS --body "26"
```

If the backup age exceeds the threshold, it posts a red Teams Adaptive Card and sends a SendGrid email alert. All notification steps use `continue-on-error: true`. This also tracks the **SLA badge** displayed on the dashboard stat card.

| Dashboard indicator | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Green badge | Last successful backup within SLA window |
| Amber badge | Approaching the SLA threshold |
| Red badge | SLA breached — backup is stale |
| Active Runs > 0 | A backup/restore is currently executing |

### 9.6 Audit Log

The **audit log** lives in the **Reports** tab and records every significant action and run outcome with timestamps. Entries are searchable in the UI and exportable to CSV for retention or ingestion into a SIEM. The `monthly-restore-test.yml` workflow appends its dry-run results to `docs/audit.log` automatically. See [14.3](#143-audit-log) for compliance use.

### 9.7 Anomaly Detection

The dashboard checks `docs/status.json` on load and compares the current session's total backup size against the 7-day rolling average. If the deviation exceeds **20%**, an amber dismissible banner appears at the top of the dashboard:

![Dashboard — Anomaly Alert](screenshots/dashboard-anomaly.svg)

In Demo Mode, the banner is always shown so evaluators can see the feature in action. To resolve a real anomaly, inspect the **Session Diff** view (see [14.2](#142-session-diff--reporting)) to identify which repositories grew or shrank unexpectedly.

### 9.8 Monthly Auto-Restore Test

`monthly-restore-test.yml` fires on the **1st of every month at 03:00 UTC**. It runs `src/restore/index.js` with `DRY_RUN=true` against the most recent backup session. The result (`success` or `failure`) is appended to `docs/audit.log` and a Teams Adaptive Card is posted.

This gives you automated evidence that your backups are actually restorable — a critical control for SOC 2 availability and ISO 27001 backup verification requirements.

---

## 10. Security

Security is foundational to a backup system because the backups themselves are a concentrated copy of everything valuable. This section covers how credentials are handled, encryption, integrity, and the GitHub-native protections you should enable.

### 10.1 Credential Handling

There are two distinct credential domains. **Workflow credentials** (`GH_BACKUP_TOKEN`, the Google secrets, optional AWS keys, the encryption key) live exclusively in **GitHub Actions encrypted secrets** and are only decrypted inside the runner at execution time — they never appear in logs if you avoid echoing them. **Dashboard credentials** (your GitHub PAT for live actions, and the Drive token) are stored **only in the browser's `localStorage`** and are sent **only to `api.github.com` and `googleapis.com`** — never to any server operated by this project, because there is no such server.

This separation means compromising the static dashboard host (GitHub Pages) does not expose your secrets, and compromising the dashboard's `localStorage` does not expose the workflow secrets. Use the **Settings → Security** tab to review credential status and clear stored tokens from the browser when you are done on a shared machine.

![Settings](screenshots/settings.svg)

### 10.2 Backup Encryption

As covered in [6.6](#66-backup-encryption), setting `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` enables **authenticated AES-256-GCM** encryption of archives at rest, written as `.zip.enc`. This protects backup contents even if the storage destination (Drive or S3) is exposed, and — because GCM is authenticated — any tampering with an encrypted archive (or use of the wrong key) is **detected and rejected on restore** rather than silently decrypting to corrupt data. The on-disk format is `GCM1 | 12-byte IV | ciphertext | 16-byte auth tag`. Archives written by versions before 5.1.0 used AES-256-CBC (`16-byte IV | ciphertext`) and are still decrypted automatically, so upgrading requires no migration. The key is never written to storage and is required for both backup (to encrypt) and restore (to decrypt). Store it redundantly in a secrets vault; losing it makes encrypted archives unrecoverable.

### 10.3 Integrity Verification

Each session can carry a **manifest** with content hashes so that restores (and the reporting layer) can verify that every expected archive is present and unmodified. Integrity verification guards against silent corruption in transit or at rest, and against partial uploads. When you perform a dry-run restore, manifest validation is part of the plan, giving you confidence before a real restore writes anything.

### 10.4 Branch Protection

Protect the workflow definitions themselves. Enable **branch protection** on your fork's default branch so that changes to `backup.yml`, `restore.yml`, `cleanup.yml`, and the secrets-consuming code require review. This prevents an attacker (or an accidental commit) from, say, adding a step that exfiltrates secrets or redirects uploads. Require pull-request reviews and status checks before merge.

### 10.5 Secret Scanning

Enable GitHub **secret scanning** and **push protection** on your fork. While the project is careful to keep credentials in Actions secrets and out of the repository, secret scanning is a defense-in-depth measure that catches an accidental commit of a token or the `credentials/*.json` files before it becomes a leak. Combined with the `.gitignore` entries for the credential files, this makes accidental exposure unlikely.

### 10.6 Security Advisories

Watch the upstream **`OmarRao/github-gdrive-backup`** repository's **Security Advisories** and keep your fork reasonably current with upstream fixes. Subscribe to releases so you learn about security-relevant changes. Periodically review and rotate `GH_BACKUP_TOKEN`, the Google token, and any cloud keys; short-lived credentials limit the blast radius of any single exposure.

### 10.7 SBOM Generation

Enable Software Bill of Materials generation by passing `include_sbom=true` when dispatching `backup.yml`. The SBOM step runs [`anchore/sbom-action@v0`](https://github.com/anchore/sbom-action) and produces an SPDX-format SBOM uploaded as a workflow artifact.

```bash
gh workflow run backup.yml -f include_sbom=true
```

The step is gated with `if: success() && github.event.inputs.include_sbom == 'true'` so it is always skipped in scheduled runs and only activates on explicit manual dispatch. SBOM artifacts are retained for 30 days alongside the run logs.

### 10.8 Status-Server Hardening

The optional Express status server (`src/server/`) that some deployments run to expose backup status is hardened for exposure beyond localhost:

- **Security headers** via [helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/).
- **Rate limiting** via [express-rate-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit) — 100 requests per 15-minute window per IP by default; tune with `API_RATE_LIMIT`.
- **Localhost binding by default.** The server listens on `127.0.0.1`. Only set `HOST=0.0.0.0` when it sits behind a trusted reverse proxy or firewall.
- **Optional API-key gate.** Set `DASHBOARD_API_KEY` to require an `x-api-key` header on all `/api` routes; the comparison uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual` to avoid timing side-channels. If no key is set, the server logs a warning and leaves `/api` open — acceptable only for localhost-only use.

The static dashboard SPA additionally ships a restrictive **Content-Security-Policy** and HTML-escapes all remote-sourced values (repo/session/run names, tooltips) to mitigate XSS.

### 10.9 Supply-Chain Hardening

- **SHA-pinned Actions.** Every third-party GitHub Action across all workflows and `action.yml` is pinned to a full commit SHA with a trailing `# vN` comment, so a compromised or retagged upstream release cannot alter a run while Dependabot still tracks new versions.
- **No install-time scripts.** Dependency installs use `npm ci --ignore-scripts` (with an `npm install --ignore-scripts` fallback) in workflows, the composite Action, and the Docker image, blocking arbitrary `postinstall` execution from dependencies.
- **OpenSSF Scorecard.** `scorecard.yml` runs the [Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) checks weekly and on push, publishing results to the code-scanning dashboard.
- **Zero known vulnerabilities.** `npm audit` is kept clean; CI fails on high/critical advisories.

### 10.10 CI Pipeline

The `ci.yml` workflow runs on every push and pull request to `main`. It is the primary gate preventing broken, insecure, or unlicensed code from merging.

![CI Pipeline](screenshots/ci-security.svg)

**Steps in order:**

1. **Checkout** — `actions/checkout` (SHA-pinned)
2. **Node.js 22** — with npm cache
3. **`npm ci`** — clean install from lockfile
4. **Copyright header check** — `node scripts/check-headers.js`; exits 1 if any `src/*.js` is missing `// Copyright (c) Omar Rao. All rights reserved.`
5. **ESLint** — `npm run lint`; rules include `no-eval`, `no-implied-eval`, `no-new-func`, `eqeqeq` (flat config, `eslint.config.js`)
6. **Jest** — `npm test`; 113 tests across 14 suites; coverage threshold ≥20% lines
7. **`npm audit`** — high/critical vulnerabilities fail CI (`continue-on-error: true` for advisory-level findings)
8. **yamllint** — validates the workflow YAML files
9. **Gitleaks** — scans for accidentally committed secrets

Static analysis (**CodeQL**, `codeql.yml`) and supply-chain scoring (**OpenSSF Scorecard**, `scorecard.yml`) run as separate scheduled/push workflows and report to the code-scanning dashboard.

Run locally before pushing:

```bash
npm run check-headers   # copyright audit
npm run lint            # ESLint
npm test                # Jest + coverage
npm run audit           # dependency security audit
```

---

## 11. CLI Usage

Everything the dashboard does over the GitHub API you can also do from the command line, which is ideal for automation, scripting, and CI of your own. The primary tools are the **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** for dispatching and inspecting workflows, and the project's **Python tooling** for local operations like token generation.

```bash
# List the three workflows and their state
gh workflow list

# Trigger a backup (optionally with inputs)
gh workflow run backup.yml -f repos="repo-a,repo-b" -f encrypt=true

# Trigger a dry-run restore from a chosen session
gh workflow run restore.yml -f session="2026-06-25T02:00Z" -f dry_run=true

# Run retention cleanup on demand
gh workflow run cleanup.yml

# Watch the latest run live
gh run watch "$(gh run list --workflow backup.yml -L1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')"

# Inspect logs of a specific run
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

The one-time **`get_token.py`** helper is the main local Python entry point; it performs the Google OAuth flow and writes `credentials/google-token.json`:

```bash
python get_token.py            # interactive Google authorization
gh secret set GOOGLE_TOKEN < credentials/google-token.json
```

For managing secrets entirely from the CLI, `gh secret set`, `gh secret list`, and `gh secret delete` cover the full lifecycle. Scripting these commands lets you stand up a new fork's secrets reproducibly, which is handy when you maintain several backup environments (for example, separate forks per team or per compliance boundary).

---

## 12. Docker Usage

For local runs, debugging, or self-hosted execution outside of GitHub-hosted runners, the tooling can run inside a container. A container packages Python and the project dependencies so you get identical behavior across machines. The example below shows mounting your credentials and passing configuration via environment variables.

```bash
# Build the image from the repository root
docker build -t gdrive-backup .

# Run a backup locally inside the container
docker run --rm \
  -e GH_USER="your-user" \
  -e GH_BACKUP_TOKEN="ghp_..." \
  -e GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID="1AbCdEf..." \
  -e BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(cat ~/.secrets/enc.key)" \
  -v "$PWD/credentials:/app/credentials:ro" \
  gdrive-backup
```

A minimal `Dockerfile` reference looks like the following; consult the version in your fork for the authoritative contents:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "backup.py"]
```

Running in Docker is also the cleanest way to reproduce a failing backup locally: mount the same credentials, pass the same environment, and you can step through the exact behavior the runner would exhibit. For scheduled local execution, pair the container with your host's cron or a systemd timer, mirroring the 02:00 UTC cadence used in CI.

---

## 13. Self-Hosted Runners

By default the workflows execute on **GitHub-hosted runners**, which require no setup. If you need to back up repositories reachable only from inside a private network, want to avoid Actions-minute consumption for very large jobs, or must keep data within a controlled environment for compliance, register a **self-hosted runner**.

```bash
# On your runner host (abridged GitHub runner setup)
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
curl -o actions-runner.tar.gz -L \
  https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/latest/download/actions-runner-linux-x64.tar.gz
tar xzf actions-runner.tar.gz
./config.sh --url https://github.com/<your-user>/github-gdrive-backup --token <reg-token>
./run.sh
```

Then point the workflows at your runner by changing `runs-on`:

```yaml
jobs:
  backup:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64]   # was: ubuntu-latest
```

Self-hosted runners carry additional responsibility: you patch the host, you secure it, and you must trust the code that runs on it. Because secrets are decrypted on the runner at execution time, treat the runner host as sensitive infrastructure — isolate it, restrict who can register workflows against it, and never use a public/self-hosted runner for a public fork where untrusted PRs could execute. For backup-only private repos this is usually a safe and powerful option that gives you network reach and resource control the hosted runners cannot.

## 14. Compliance & Reporting

For regulated environments, a backup is only as good as your ability to *prove* it happened. The reporting layer turns operational history into auditable evidence, and the dashboard can export that evidence in formats auditors expect.

### 14.1 Compliance CSV Export

From the **Reports** tab, the **Export CSV** button downloads the full run history as a comma-separated file: columns include timestamp, session ID, run status, repository count, duration, storage target, and the GitHub run URL. This CSV is the primary evidence artifact for audit submissions.

![Reports](screenshots/reports.svg)

Retain CSV exports according to your framework's record-keeping requirements. Consider feeding them into a SIEM for tamper-evidence and long-term log aggregation.

### 14.2 Session Diff & Reporting

The **Session Diff** view in the Reports tab lets you compare any two backup sessions side by side. Select Session A (older) and Session B (newer), then click **Compare**:

![Session Diff](screenshots/reports-diff.svg)

The comparison table shows:
- **Added** repositories (present in B, absent in A) — highlighted in green
- **Removed** repositories (present in A, absent in B) — highlighted in red
- **Changed** repositories with exact byte delta and percentage change
- **Unchanged** repositories for completeness

Use Session Diff as a routine sanity check after major code pushes, and as an investigation tool when the anomaly detection banner fires.

### 14.3 Audit Log

The audit log lives in `docs/audit.log` (appended by workflows) and is surfaced in the **Reports** tab. It records:
- Every scheduled and manual backup run outcome
- Restore workflow executions
- Monthly auto-restore dry-run results (from `monthly-restore-test.yml`)
- SLA breach events

Entries are searchable in the UI and exportable to CSV. The log is also a key audit artifact for the frameworks below.

### 14.4 Supported Frameworks (SOX, HIPAA, ISO 27001, SOC 2)

| Framework | Relevant project capability |
|---|---|
| **SOX** | Audit log, age-based retention, change control via branch protection, CSV export |
| **HIPAA** | AES-256-CBC encryption at rest, access control allow-list, integrity verification, SBOM |
| **ISO 27001** | Backup/restore procedures, SLA tracking, monthly restore test, PAT rotation reminder |
| **SOC 2** | Availability (SLA tracker + hourly check), confidentiality (encryption), monitoring (audit log + anomaly detection) |

Combine the periodic CSV audit-log exports (continuous record) with SLA and retention settings documentation and the monthly restore test audit entries — together these demonstrate not just that controls exist, but that they operate effectively over time.

---

## 15. PWA & Offline Support

The dashboard is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**. Two files enable this:

- **`docs/manifest.json`** — declares the app name, icons, theme color (`#166534`), and `display: standalone` so it opens in its own window without browser chrome.
- **`docs/sw.js`** — a cache-first service worker that caches the app shell (`/github-gdrive-backup/` and `/github-gdrive-backup/index.html`) on install.

![PWA Install](screenshots/pwa-install.svg)

**Installing the PWA:**

Most modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari on iOS) show an **Install** prompt in the address bar or menu when they detect a valid manifest + service worker. On the dashboard, you can also look for the install prompt that appears automatically in the browser bar. After installation, the app:
- Opens in a standalone window with no browser UI
- Loads instantly from cache even without a network connection
- Serves the cached shell for any navigation miss (so you can view reports offline)

**Service worker cache strategy:**
1. On first load, the shell URLs are pre-cached.
2. On fetch, the service worker checks the cache first; on a cache hit it responds immediately.
3. On a navigate miss (no cache entry), it falls back to the cached shell — preventing blank screens offline.
4. On update (new deployment), old caches are deleted and the new shell is cached during the activate phase.

**Cache invalidation:** update the `CACHE` constant in `docs/sw.js` (e.g. `gh-backup-v2`) after major UI changes to force all clients to re-cache on next load.

---

## 15A. Dashboard Insights & Productivity (v3.1)

Version 3.1 adds a layer of at-a-glance intelligence and keyboard-first navigation to the dashboard. None of these features require new secrets or a server — they are computed entirely in the browser from data already loaded.

### System Health panel

Directly under the stat cards, the **System Health** grid gives a traffic-light read on the whole system. **Every tile is interactive** — click (or focus + Enter) any tile to jump straight to the section that explains or acts on it:

| Tile | Green | Amber | Red | Opens |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Last Backup | Success | — | Failed | Workflow Runs |
| SLA | Within threshold | — | Breached | Reports |
| Anomaly | Normal | Detected (>20% size deviation) | — | Reports |
| Restore Verified | Verified (with RTO) | — | Failed | Restore |
| Manifest Signature | Signed | — | — | Settings |
| Storage | ≤80% used | 80–90% | >90% | Settings |
| GitHub | Connected | — | — | Settings |
| Drive | Connected | — | — | Settings |

### Storage Growth chart

A modern, gradient-filled **smooth area chart** plots the size (MB) of the last 10 backup sessions oldest→newest, with light gridlines, MB y-axis labels, and dated x-axis ticks. It renders at the container's exact pixel size (1 SVG unit = 1 px) so strokes and text stay crisp at any width — no stretching. **Hover (or keyboard-focus) any point** to see an interactive tooltip with that session's name, size, delta mode (full/delta/unchanged), and date; the point enlarges to mark the active selection. Use it to spot steady growth (plan capacity) or sudden drops (investigate with Session Diff).

### Backup Timeline heatmap

A 30-day, GitHub-contributions-style heatmap. Each cell is one day, colored by backup volume (five green shades); days with a failed backup are red, and days with no backup stay grey. Hover any cell for the date and size.

![Dashboard Insights](screenshots/dashboard-insights.svg)

### Session detail drawer

Click any session in **Restore** (or its **Details** button) to slide open a right-hand drawer showing a **Restore Confidence Score** (a 0–100 ring synthesized from run status and integrity metadata) and a per-repository size breakdown. Failed repos are flagged inline.

### Command palette

Press <kbd>⌘</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> anywhere — even inside a text field — to open a fuzzy command palette. Type to filter across pages (Dashboard, Backup, Restore, …) and actions (trigger backup, export CSV/JSON, toggle theme, open notifications). Navigate with <kbd>↑</kbd>/<kbd>↓</kbd>, run with <kbd>↵</kbd>, dismiss with <kbd>Esc</kbd>.

![Command Palette](screenshots/command-palette.svg)

### Notification center

Every toast is also persisted (last 30, in `localStorage`) to a bell dropdown in the top bar. An unread badge shows the count; opening the panel marks them read. Use **Clear all** to empty it.

### Report JSON export

The **Reports** tab now offers an **Export JSON** button alongside CSV and the compliance PDF. The JSON payload includes an `exported_at` timestamp, repository name, run count, and a structured array of every run (id, workflow, status, event, timestamp, duration) — ideal for feeding downstream tooling or SIEM ingestion.

---

## 15C. Trust & Distribution (v5.0)

Version 5.0 makes recoverability and integrity **provable**, and packages the tool for one-line adoption.

![Trust & Distribution](screenshots/trust-distribution.svg)

### Signed manifests (Ed25519)
SHA-256 hashes in the manifest catch corruption; they do not prove a backup wasn't *forged* by whoever can write to the bucket. Set `BACKUP_SIGNING_KEY` to a PEM Ed25519 private key and each session's `manifest.json` is signed to `manifest.json.sig` (`src/lib/manifest-signing.js`). On restore, set `BACKUP_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY` to verify it; the result (`valid` / `invalid` / `unsigned` / `no-key`) is logged and returned. Set `BACKUP_REQUIRE_SIGNATURE=true` to **abort** a restore on a missing or invalid signature. The signing public-key fingerprint is recorded in `backup-summary.json`. Generate a keypair with `require('./src/lib/manifest-signing').generateKeyPair()`.

### Recovery scorecard
The monthly restore drill (`monthly-restore-test.yml`) times the dry-run and publishes `docs/recovery-scorecard.json` via `src/lib/recovery-scorecard.js` — `status`, `last_verified`, and `rto_seconds`. It renders as the **Restore Verified** shields.io endpoint badge in the README and a **Restore Verified** tile in the dashboard's System Health panel, turning "backups exist" into "restores are verified, and here's how fast."

### Tamper-evident audit log
Audit entries (`src/audit/log.js`) are hash-chained: each entry carries `prev` (the SHA-256 of the previous entry) and its own `hash`. `verifyChain()` detects any edit (`hash-mismatch`) or deletion (`prev-mismatch`), so the audit trail cannot be silently rewritten.

### Use as a GitHub Action
`action.yml` exposes the backup as a composite action — `uses: OmarRao/github-gdrive-backup@v5` — so consumers compose it into their own workflows without forking. Inputs cover token/folder/credentials plus `incremental-mode`, `mirror-targets`, `zip-level`, `encryption-key`, and `signing-key`; it emits a JSON `summary` output.

### Container image (GHCR)
`publish.yml` builds and pushes `ghcr.io/omarrao/github-gdrive-backup` on each release, attaching an SBOM and a signed build-provenance attestation. Run it directly: `docker run ghcr.io/omarrao/github-gdrive-backup:v5 backup`.

---

## 15B. Reliability & Operations (v3.5)

Version 3.5 is a reliability, DR-depth, and operations release. Highlights:

### Chain-aware cleanup (retention safety)
`src/cleanup/index.js` now runs a pure `planCleanup()` that, before deleting any aged session, reads the `backup-state.json` of every **retained** session and protects the entire delta chain each one depends on. An old **base** or intermediate bundle is never deleted while a newer session still needs it to restore — closing a data-loss hazard inherent to naive age-based pruning of delta chains. Protected-but-old sessions are logged explicitly.

### Chain compaction
`INCREMENTAL_MAX_CHAIN` (default 20) caps delta-chain depth. When a repo's chain would exceed it, the next backup takes a **fresh full base** instead of another delta — keeping restores fast and bounding how long any single base must be retained.

### Post-restore verification
After pushing (or saving locally), restore compares the destination's ref tips against the reconstructed source and reports `{ verified, refs, mismatches }` per repo. A restore that "ran" is now a restore that's **proven**.

### Local restore (no push)
`RESTORE_TARGET_PROVIDER=local` reconstructs each repo to a bare mirror under `RESTORE_LOCAL_DIR` (`<repo>.git`) with no remote and no credentials — ideal for DR drills, audits, and migrations into unsupported systems.

### Repo configuration backup
`INCLUDE=config` captures repository settings, default-branch protection rules, collaborators, webhook shapes, and the **names** of Actions secrets (values are never retrievable via the API and are never stored) into `metadata.json` — config-level DR beyond code.

### Issues/PR archive & re-creation
Every session with issues/PRs gets a self-contained, browsable `issues.html` (no tooling needed, works offline). On GitHub restores you can opt into best-effort **issue re-creation** (`recreate_issues`) with a provenance note and original-state preservation.

### WORM / object lock
Set `S3_OBJECT_LOCK_DAYS` / `B2_OBJECT_LOCK_DAYS` (bucket Object Lock enabled) to make mirrored copies immutable until the retention date — ransomware-proof secondary copies. Mode defaults to `GOVERNANCE`; use `COMPLIANCE` for un-bypassable locks.

### Composition, chain lineage & restore wizard (dashboard)
The dashboard shows the latest session's **delta composition** (full/delta/unchanged) and **fan-out** mirror status; the session drawer visualizes each repo's **chain lineage**; and the **Restore Wizard** generates the exact `gh workflow run restore.yml` command for any provider and session.

![Composition & Restore Wizard](screenshots/composition-wizard.svg)

### Operations
- **Integration smoke test** (`integration-smoke.yml`) — secrets-gated CI that runs a **real** delta backup to Drive and a local restore, verifying reconstructed git history; self-skips without secrets.
- **Dependabot auto-merge** — grouped patch/minor updates are auto-approved and merged once CI passes.
- **Build provenance** — CI generates an SPDX SBOM and signs it via `actions/attest-build-provenance`.
- **JSON audit log** (`src/audit/log.js`) — structured, SIEM-ingestible JSON-lines entries.

---

## 16. Troubleshooting

Most issues fall into a handful of categories: authentication, permissions, storage, and scheduling. The table below maps common symptoms to likely causes and fixes.

| Symptom | Likely cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Backup fails immediately with auth error | `GH_BACKUP_TOKEN` expired or missing scopes | Recreate PAT with `repo, workflow, read:org, read:user`; reset secret |
| Google Drive upload fails | `GOOGLE_TOKEN` invalid/expired or wrong `GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID` | Re-run `python get_token.py`; verify folder ID |
| Org repos not backed up | PAT lacks `read:org` or org not in multi-org list | Add scope; add org in Settings → Accounts |
| Archives unreadable / can't restore | Wrong or lost `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Supply the exact key used at backup time |
| Dashboard live buttons do nothing | In Demo Mode (yellow banner shown) | Sign in and enter tokens in Settings |
| SLA badge red despite recent runs | Runs failing or schedule delayed | Check Workflow Runs / Reports for failures |
| S3 uploads fail | Missing AWS keys or `STORAGE_TARGET` not set | Set AWS secrets and `STORAGE_TARGET=s3` |
| Azure Blob uploads fail | Missing connection string or wrong container name | Set `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` and `AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME` |
| B2 uploads fail | Wrong endpoint or credentials | Verify `B2_ENDPOINT` format (e.g. `https://s3.us-west-004.backblazeb2.com`) and key scopes |
| Drive uploads start failing | Drive quota exhausted | Shorten retention, move to S3/B2, or upgrade storage |
| Teams / email notifications not firing | Secrets absent or wrong format | Verify `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` / `SENDGRID_API_KEY` in repo secrets |
| PAT rotation reminder not sending | `PAT_EXPIRY_DATE` secret not set | Set `PAT_EXPIRY_DATE` as `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| PWA not installable | Missing `manifest.json` or `sw.js` not registered | Confirm the `<link rel="manifest">` tag in `docs/index.html` and `sw.js` is at the correct path |
| Anomaly banner shown unexpectedly | Large repo added or removed since last session | Use Session Diff to identify the repo causing size change |

When diagnosing, start with the **Workflow Runs** view and open the failing run's logs (or `gh run view <id> --log`). The first error line is almost always the real cause; later lines are cascade effects. For local reproduction, run the same job in Docker (see [Section 12](#12-docker-usage)) with identical environment variables. If the dashboard behaves unexpectedly, check the browser console and confirm whether you are in Demo Mode — the yellow banner and the "Sign in to use live features" toast are the giveaways.

For persistent or unexplained failures, verify each secret's presence from **Settings → Actions Secrets**, confirm token expiry dates, and check the upstream repository's issues and Security Advisories for known problems. Re-running `get_token.py` resolves the majority of Google-side authentication failures, since an expired or revoked refresh token is the most common culprit.

## 17. FAQ

**Is my GitHub token ever sent to a server you control?**
No. The dashboard is a static site with no backend. Your PAT and Drive token live only in browser `localStorage` and are sent only to `api.github.com` and `googleapis.com`. Workflow secrets live in GitHub's encrypted secret store and are decrypted only inside the runner.

**Do I have to set up Firebase?**
No. Firebase enables Google Sign-In on the dashboard, but it is optional. Without it, the dashboard offers **Demo Mode** only. Demo Mode never makes real API calls and is perfectly safe to share publicly.

**What exactly is backed up?**
Repositories are fetched as git mirrors, capturing full commit history, branches, and tags. Each backup session produces a self-contained, restorable archive per repository under a timestamped folder in your storage destination.

**Can I back up private repositories and organizations?**
Yes. The PAT scopes `repo` and `read:org` enable private and organization backups. Configure organizations in **Settings → Accounts/multi-org**.

**How do I recover a specific past state?**
Use the **Restore** tab to pick a session by timestamp (point-in-time recovery), run a **dry-run** to validate, then perform a full restore to your chosen target owner.

**What happens if I lose my encryption key?**
Encrypted archives (`.zip.enc`) are unrecoverable without `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Store the key redundantly in a vault. Unencrypted backups are unaffected.

**Does this support storage other than Google Drive?**
Yes — Amazon S3 (`STORAGE_TARGET=s3`), Azure Blob Storage (`STORAGE_TARGET=azure`), and Backblaze B2 (`STORAGE_TARGET=b2`) are all implemented. See [Section 8.2](#82-s3--azure-blob--backblaze-b2) for required secrets.

**Are Slack and email notifications available?**
Yes — set `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` for MS Teams Adaptive Cards and `SENDGRID_API_KEY` for HTML email digests via `notify.yml`. Legacy Slack support via `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is also present.

**What is the Session Diff feature?**
It lets you compare any two backup sessions side by side in the Reports tab, showing added, removed, and changed repositories with exact byte deltas. Useful for spotting unexpected growth or missing repos after a change.

**What does the anomaly detection banner mean?**
When the current backup session's total size deviates more than 20% from the 7-day rolling average, an amber warning banner appears on the dashboard. Use Session Diff to investigate which repository changed unexpectedly.

**Can I install the dashboard as an app?**
Yes — the dashboard is a PWA. Modern browsers will offer an Install prompt. After installation it launches in a standalone window and serves cached content offline. See [Section 15](#15-pwa--offline-support).

**How does retention/cleanup work?**
`cleanup.yml` uses simple age-based retention: sessions older than `RETENTION_DAYS` (default 21) are deleted on the weekly Sunday schedule. It is chain-aware — it never deletes a base/intermediate bundle a retained delta chain still needs. Override the window with `gh workflow run cleanup.yml -f retention_days=30`.

**How do I get notified before my PAT expires?**
Set the `PAT_EXPIRY_DATE` secret to your PAT's expiry date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. The `pat-check.yml` workflow runs every Monday and sends a Teams card + email when the PAT is ≤7 days from expiry.

**What is the monthly auto-restore test?**
`monthly-restore-test.yml` fires on the 1st of each month and runs a dry-run restore (`DRY_RUN=true`). The result is appended to `docs/audit.log` and posted to Teams — providing automated evidence that backups are actually restorable.

**How much does it cost to run?**
The dashboard (GitHub Pages) and Actions minutes are typically free for personal use. Costs scale with repository size, backup frequency, retention window, and your storage plan (Drive or S3).

**How do I change the backup schedule?**
Edit the cron expression in `backup.yml` and commit. The default is `0 2 * * *` (02:00 UTC daily).

---

## 19. New Features (v3.0.0)

### 19.1 Email Digest (SendGrid)

Every backup run now sends an HTML email digest via SendGrid. Set the `SENDGRID_API_KEY` secret to activate. The email includes workflow conclusion, run URL, and timestamp. If the secret is absent the step is silently skipped.

### 19.2 MS Teams Adaptive Card

`notify.yml` posts a colour-coded Adaptive Card to MS Teams on every run (green on success, red on failure). Set `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` secret. Skipped gracefully when not configured.

### 19.3 PAT Rotation Reminder

A weekly workflow (`pat-check.yml`, Mondays 08:00 UTC) checks `PAT_EXPIRY_DATE` (format `YYYY-MM-DD`) and posts a warning card to Teams and sends an email when the PAT is within 7 days of expiry. `backup.yml` also alerts immediately via Teams if the PAT is already expired during a run.

### 19.4 Dashboard Run Search & Repo Count

- **Dashboard**: a search box above "Recent Workflow Runs" lets you filter runs by name or status in real time.
- **Backup page**: a "Showing X of Y repos" counter appears between the search bar and the repository list, updating as you type.

### 19.5 Session Diff

The **Reports** page now includes a **Session Diff** card. Select two sessions from the dropdowns and click **Compare** to see a table showing each repository's size in Session A and Session B, the delta, and whether repos were added or removed. Works in demo mode with sample data.

### 19.6 Age-Based Retention

`cleanup.yml` applies simple age-based retention (default 21 days) on the weekly Sunday schedule, authenticating with the OAuth refresh token. It is chain-aware — it protects any base/intermediate bundle a retained delta chain still needs — and logs deleted/kept (including chain-protected) counts. *(Earlier drafts referenced a "GFS" mode that was only ever logged, never enforced; that has been removed so the workflow no longer claims a policy the code does not implement — see issue #33.)*

### 19.7 SLA Breach Alerts

A new hourly workflow (`sla-check.yml`) reads `docs/status.json` and compares the `last_run` timestamp against `SLA_HOURS` (default 26). On breach it posts a Teams Adaptive Card and sends a SendGrid email with the breach duration.

### 19.8 Compliance CSV Export

The **Export CSV** button in Reports now produces a file with columns: `run_id`, `workflow`, `status`, `timestamp`, `duration`, `repo_count`. In demo mode it uses sample data so the export works without a live connection.

### 19.9 Anomaly Detection

`backup.yml` compares the current session's total zip size against the `avg_size_7d` field in `docs/status.json`. If the delta exceeds 20% it sets `anomaly: true` in `status.json` and posts a warning Teams card. The Dashboard reads this flag on load and shows a dismissible amber banner above the stat cards.

### 19.10 Azure Blob Storage

`src/backup/storage/azure.js` implements the same `uploadFile` / `getOrCreateSessionFolder` interface as the S3 adapter. Activate with `STORAGE_TARGET=azure`, `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`, and `AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME`.

### 19.11 Backblaze B2 Storage

`src/backup/storage/b2.js` re-uses the AWS SDK against B2's S3-compatible endpoint. Set `B2_ENDPOINT`, `B2_KEY_ID`, `B2_APP_KEY`, and `B2_BUCKET`, then set `STORAGE_TARGET=b2`.

### 19.12 SBOM Generation

`backup.yml` accepts an `include_sbom` boolean input. When `true`, [anchore/sbom-action](https://github.com/anchore/sbom-action) generates an SPDX-JSON SBOM and uploads it as a workflow artifact named `sbom-<run-id>`.

### 19.13 Monthly Auto-Restore Test

`monthly-restore-test.yml` runs on the 1st of each month at 03:00 UTC. It exercises the restore pipeline in dry-run mode, verifies archive integrity, and appends the result to `docs/audit.log`. A Teams card reports pass/fail.

### 19.14 PWA Support

The dashboard is now installable as a Progressive Web App:
- `docs/manifest.json` — web app manifest with name, icons, colours, and `start_url`.
- `docs/sw.js` — cache-first service worker for offline shell support.
- `<meta name="theme-color">` and `<link rel="manifest">` added to `<head>`.
- Service worker auto-registered on page load.

| **2.1.0** | 2026-06-26 | **Firebase Google Sign-In**, **Demo Mode** (sample data, yellow banner, no live calls), full UX overhaul, refreshed stat cards and reports, keyboard shortcuts, dark mode polish |
| **2.0.0** | 2026-02-10 | Multi-org backups, GitLab source, point-in-time restore with dry-run, S3 storage target, AES-256-CBC encryption, SLA tracker, Compliance PDF export |
| **1.0.0** | 2025-09-01 | Initial release: scheduled daily Google Drive backup via GitHub Actions (`backup.yml`, `restore.yml`, `cleanup.yml`), basic dashboard, retention/cleanup |

**v3.0.0 — 2026-06-30.** The operational completeness release. **Email Digest** (SendGrid REST API, no SMTP) and **MS Teams Webhook** (Adaptive Cards, color-coded by conclusion) bring rich multi-channel notifications to `notify.yml`. **PAT Rotation Reminder** (`pat-check.yml`, weekly) and **SLA Breach Alerts** (`sla-check.yml`, hourly) make proactive ops monitoring automatic. **Session Diff** in the Reports tab compares any two sessions side by side with byte deltas. **GFS Retention** (`cleanup.yml`, `retention_policy=gfs`) tiers daily/weekly/monthly session keeps. **Anomaly Detection** surfaces a dismissible dashboard banner when session size deviates >20% from the 7-day average. Storage gains two new backends: **Azure Blob** (`src/backup/storage/azure.js`) and **Backblaze B2** (`src/backup/storage/b2.js`). **SBOM generation** via `anchore/sbom-action@v0` is available as an optional `backup.yml` input. **Monthly Auto-Restore Test** (`monthly-restore-test.yml`) dry-runs the restore pipeline on the 1st of each month and logs results to `docs/audit.log`. The dashboard is now a **PWA** with `manifest.json` and a cache-first service worker (`sw.js`) for offline support and home-screen installation.

**v2.1.0 — 2026-06-26.** This release focuses on accessibility and trust. **Demo Mode** lets anyone explore the entire dashboard with realistic sample data and zero setup, clearly marked by a persistent yellow banner; live action buttons surface a "Sign in to use live features" toast rather than acting. **Firebase Google Sign-In** (configured via `FIREBASE_CONFIG` in `docs/index.html`) gates live features behind authenticated identity while keeping backup tokens strictly in `localStorage`. The UI received a comprehensive overhaul — clearer stat cards with SLA badges, richer reports (success rate, streak, bar chart, sparklines), and refined dark mode.

**v2.0.0 — 2026-02-10.** The platform release: backups expanded beyond a single account to **multiple organizations** and an optional **GitLab source**; restores gained **point-in-time session selection** and a **dry-run** safety mode; storage gained an **S3 target**; and security gained **AES-256-CBC encryption** at rest. Operational maturity arrived with the **SLA tracker** and **Compliance PDF export** for SOX, HIPAA, ISO 27001, and SOC 2 evidence.

**v1.0.0 — 2025-09-01.** The foundation: a serverless, Actions-driven daily backup of GitHub repositories to Google Drive, with the three core workflows and a first-generation dashboard for visibility and retention management.
